I was just about to go make these changes and discovered that the
user_id and group_id options are already mandatory, due to this check at
the bottom of parse_fuse_opt():

        if (!d->fd_present || !d->rootmode_present ||
            !d->user_id_present || !d->group_id_present)
                return 0;

So I'll simply drop those two lines which supply default values for
these options.

Thanks,
Seth
