Ideally what will happen is that when we get RPCSECGSSv3 in we'll set 
the security context in the same place that we set uid and gid for the 
process in the auth code. Until then you're right server side 
enforcement really isn't possible because we have whatever context the 
kernel gives to the thread being our security context. In the SELinux 
case this is the all powerful kernel_t in the smack case its the floor 
context.
