iirc the idea to have read only maps was brought up in the past
(unfortunately no one took a stab at implementing it), but imo
that's better then relying on lsm to provide such restriction
and more secure, since even if you disable map_update via lsm,
the user can craft a program just to udpate the map from it.
For bpffs we already test for inode_permission(inode, MAY_WRITE);
during BPF_OBJ_GET command and we can extend this facility further.
Also we can allow dropping 'write' permissions from the map
(internally implemented via flag in struct bpf_map), so
update/delete operations won't be allowed.
This flag will be checked by syscall during map_update/delete
and by the verifier if such read-only map is used by the program
being loaded, so map_update/helpers won't be allowed in
such program.
Would also be good to support read-only programs as well
(progs that are read-only from kernel state point of view)
They won't be able to modify packets, maps, etc.
