Hey now, there was a little more nuance to it than that[1][2].  The
complaint in the first instance had much more to do with breaking
existing V4 filesystems by adding format requirements that mkfs didn't
know about when the filesystem was created.  Yes, you can create V4
filesystems that will hang the system if the log was totally unformatted
and metadata updates are made, but OTOH it's fairly obvious when that
happens, you have to be root to mount a disk filesystem, and we try to
avoid breaking existing users.

XFS developers have been and will continue to examine security problems
when they are brought to our attention and strengthen validation as
needed to minimize the risk of incorrect behaviors, but filesystems are
complex machines, complex machinery is risky, and we arbitrate some of
that risk by requiring administrators to elect to mount an XFS.

Crossing our fingers and demanding administrator intentionality when
mounting filesystems off some piece of storage.
