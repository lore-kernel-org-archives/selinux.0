Why are you talking about file_open()?  It is may_create() that has the
duplicated logic, which has the parent dir passed to it by its callers
(selinux_inode_create, selinux_inode_symlink, selinux_inode_mkdir,
selinux_mknod).  selinux_inode_init_security() also gets passed the
parent dir directly.  Only selinux_dentry_init_security() has to use
d_parent, which as you say is safe, so it can just pass the resulting
dir to the helper.

Until a process writes to the file, we just want to use the lower inode
label, right?  At the point a process writes to the file and a copy-up
is produced, we could perform a one-time computation, and then once the
upper inode is created, it should get set accordingly.  So I wouldn't
think we would need to call security_transition_sid() frequently.  If
so, we might want to do what was previously done in the userspace AVC in
libselinux, and start caching security_transition_sid() results in the
AVC itself and add an avc_transition_sid() interface (in the userspace
AVC, this is avc_compute_create()).
