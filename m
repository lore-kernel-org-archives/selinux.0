The only reason for having this new hook in inet_accept() is to catch
all the in-kernel "daemons" who do not go through the LSM hooked
accept() code path.  I debated putting this hook into the patchset and
in the end figured it was at least worth a shot.

I'm happy to drop this hook as it *looks* like the MLSXFRM patchset is
going to make it which has some of the accept hooks I was hoping to get,
but figured I stood a "snowballs chance in hell" trying to get it in
solely for use with CIPSO :)  I'll drop this on the next release of the
NetLabel patchset and assuming both the NetLabel and the MLSXFRM
patchset make it into the 2.6.19 release I'll issue another small
patchset then to integrate into the new LSM hooks for accept.  I'd do it
now but I think it would cause too much of a mess with patch
dependencies/collisions/etc.

... and I was surprised you didn't comment about that change sooner ;)
