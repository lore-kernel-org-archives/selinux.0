Ah, my mistake, for some reason I thought it did, I guess I had offered
to take it that way if the developers wanted it.

And yes, doing all of the needed cleanups and other changes outside of
the kernel tree should be much much faster, which is why I bet it would
only take 6 months max to get lustre merged "properly" if they really
wanted to do it, by working out-of-tree.

Heck, they already have an out-of-tree repo today, so it's not like
removing the in-kernel version is going to change their normal
development workflow :(
