Paul generated a patch for us against 2.6.26-5 that we have on about  
20 developer and test boxes with good results in MLS enforcing. We are  
adding IPSec between machines and static fallback labels  to the test  
mix and will report any issues. We have a couple of 8 core machines  
I'll stress test on to look for SMP issues.
