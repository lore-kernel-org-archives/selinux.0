The capability check doesn't always require a namespace match, and I
don't care about non-user namespaces here, but I would prefer it if
A->B with A having some capabilities required A's user namespace to be
ancestor-or-self of B's user namespace. But alternatively:

It seems to me that it would make sense to express this as something
like a Kconfig dependency. But I guess if you document that the
combination of CONFIG_USER_NS=y,
CONFIG_SECURITY_SIDECHANNEL_NAMESPACES=n and
SECURITY_SIDECHANNEL_CAPABILITIES=y is nonsensical, that works too. I
just don't see why you'd want to provide such a footgun?
Configurability is nice, but if we know that one of the possible
configurations doesn't make sense, it seems like a good idea to just
not allow the system to be configured that way.

You say that you were asked to make the configuration flexible. Did
whoever told you that actually want the ability to compare raw
capability sets on a system with CONFIG_USER_NS=y, and understand what
semantics that has (and doesn't have)? Or was their intent more along
the lines of "we want to flush if the new task has higher privileges,
capability-wise, than the old task; but we don't explicitly care about
namespaces"?
