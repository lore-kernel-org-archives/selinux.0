Whenever a new queue is created via TUNSETQUEUE/tun_set_queue() the 
security_tun_dev_create_queue() LSM hook is called.  When SELinux is enabled 
this hook ends up calling selinux_tun_dev_create_queue() which checks that the 
calling process (process_t) is allowed to create a new queue on the specified 
device (tundev_t) .  If you are familiar with SELinux security policy, the 
allow rule would look like this:

  allow process_t tundev_t:tun_socket create_queue;

In practice, if we assume libvirt is creating the TUN device and running with 
a SELinux label of virtd_t and that QEMU instances are running with a SELinux 
label of svirt_t then the allow rule would look like this:

  allow svirt_t virtd_t:tun_socket create_queue;

There is also the matter of the MLS/MCS constraints providing additional 
separation but that is another level of detail which I don't believe is 
important for our discussion.
