Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe libvirt does this while running as 
root.  Assuming that is the case, why not simply setuid()/setgid() to the same 
credentials as the QEMU instance before creating the TUN device?  You can 
always (re)configure the device afterwards while running as 
root/CAP_NET_ADMIN.

If libvirt creates the TUN device while its effective credentials match those 
of the QEMU instance then the QEMU instance should be able to perform a 
TUNSETQUEUE, yes?
