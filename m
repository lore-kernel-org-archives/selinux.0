Hi Stephen,

Sorry, I don't understand this point of leaking data through overlay. Even
if we retain lower label on copy up (for device file), to open that file
process should have access on overlay context label and then mounter needs
to have access on upper inode (lower label). This is not different from
opening a file on lower. Just that metadata of this file on upper might
be different.

Can you elaborate a bit more on how this is leaking data through overlay
mount. If it is, then why accessing file on lower is not equivalent of
leaking of data. 

Thanks
Vivek
