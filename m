cc:ing SELinux and LSM lists bc this somewhat changes the
ipc msg_msg restore behavior - which was previously broken,
and now is hopefully merely dubious.  The original email

Except it wouldn't be fine, because SELinux chooses a label for the
new msg_msg based on both the task's and the queue's contexts.  And
we have no idea whether the task's context has changed since the
msg was sent.

Now, it seems like letting restart choose the labels may promote
bypassing of assured pipelines, but then you can't guarantee original
security guarantees anyway unless you have an assured pipeline
from checkpoint->restart, whether enforced through SELinux
policy or through TPM.  And if you have that, then the msg_msg
context can't be surruptitiously changed before restart.

So there is no ideal solution for SELinux, but always doing label
restore for msg_msg, with the requirement that the restarter be
allowed msg_msg:restore permission to the restored msg_msg type,
seems the best answer.
