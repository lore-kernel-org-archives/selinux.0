ok so that seems to work for SELinux as well. Never knew about that. 
I'd always just rip the xattr out of the inode with getfattr.

Ok so this is the problem. nfsd is a kernel thread I believe. In 
SELinux land it has the type kernel_t which is all powerful. We don't 
have client label transport yet (That requires RPCSECGSSv3). Is there a 
way you can have that kernel thread running as a type that has access to 
everything? I think that is the current problem. Which makes perfect 
sense. If your kernel threads don't get started with max privilege then 
the server would be denied access on all of the file attributes and 
wouldn't be able to ship it over the wire properly. I'm not sure what 
you need to do but you'll probably have to work this out. We have a 
usage mode in the IETF spec which has a non-mac enforcing server which 
still support object labeling. In the SELinux case it works for us since 
kernel_t can access anything. Ideally when RPCSECGSSv3 is finished and 
merged we'll be able to choose whether to use the label of the process 
on the client side or kernel_t for the server if its not available.

I'm not out of here until really late tonight so getting an Ubuntu VM 
setup probably won't happen until sometime next week when everything 
calms down. However I think we isolated the problem above. If I'm 
correct this is strictly a smack labeling problem. I don't know if you 
need to put some code into smack to init kernel threads with a more 
powerful label or not so I'll leave it up to you on how to address this.
