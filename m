Yes, that case is fine.

Likewise.

Only if the filesystem ultimately calls security_inode_init_security()
on the new inode.  Originally we had the vfs call post_create() hooks to
do this, but that was racy and unsafe, so we had to take the
initialization down into the filesystem code and replicate it in each
filesystem that supports labeling.  So whether or not that label will in
fact be assigned to the inode depends on the filesystem in question.
Currently called by btrfs, ext[234], f2fs, gfs2, hfsplus, jffs2, jfs,
ocsfs2, xfs.  Not sure what filesystems you have in mind for the
unionmount scenario.

Thanks.

Looks like you can get it from the other inode, as long as they are
guaranteed to have the same class (which in turn will be true as long as
they have the same file type value from the mode).
