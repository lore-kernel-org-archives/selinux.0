Okay, I misunderstood what was specified at boot time; I thought the stacking 
order could be defined at boot but based on your example I'm guessing the 
stacking order is defined at compile time and you can only enable/disable LSMs 
at boot?

Yes.

In fact, considering the example above, and also assuming I'm understanding it 
correctly, I think I am more in favor of the first-come-first-served approach 
since you can enable/disable LSMs at boot.  Imagine if you gave one LSM all 
the non-shared functionality but disabled it at boot in favor of another LSM 
which could make use of some of this functionality but was denied due to the 
compile time option.  This seems much more useful to me.

February is "fitness month".
