For CAP_FOWNER, yes (and it is already there).  CAP_MAC_ADMIN is less
ideal as it isn't clearly tied to filesystem accesses, and likewise for
CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE (but that one is included in CAP_FS_MASK already).
Ideally the capability space would be partitioned into capabilities that
affect filesystem accesses and the rest so that setfsuid() would yield
the expected behavior of only affecting filesystem access.
CAP_SYS_ADMIN is even less suitable due to its pervasive use outside of
the filesystem.  So that's the first concern.

The second one is that we don't want CAP_SYS_ADMIN (or CAP_MAC_ADMIN) to
be required when setting SELinux labels.  Only the SELinux permission
checks should govern setting those labels (aside from the usual DAC
ownership || CAP_FOWNER check).

It would narrow the scope a bit more, but it still isn't ideal.

I'd favor changing it to a new capability.  We have CAP_SETFCAP for
setting file capabilities; why not have CAP_SETTRUSTED for setting
attributes in the trusted namespace?  Then adding it to CAP_FS_MASK has
no further side effects beyond controlling filesystem accesses.
