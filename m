Hi Dan,

Thanks for sticking with this patchset, I'm working through it right
now and I have a question on the overall design (below).

Perhaps I'll end up answering this for myself as I work my way through
the patches, but hopefully you are handling the case where a destroy
operation fails and the QP needs to be revalidated?

I'm also wondering if QP revalidation on a security policy change is
worth the trouble; we've historically not been able to provide any
revoke guarantees so I'm not sure if it is worth a lot of added
complexity to gain this functionality just for Infiniband.  That said,
it would be *nice* to have revalidation/revocation working, even if
only for IB.  It may be that we need similar code to handle the
various corner cases, so we may be stuck with the complexity anyway, I
just thought it was worth bringing up as a topic of discussion.
