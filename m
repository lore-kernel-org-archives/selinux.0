Well, actually this is what the helper does:

    sprintf(d, "fd=%i,rootmode=%o,user_id=%u,group_id=%u",
        fd, rootmode, getuid(), getgid());

So it just uses the current uid/gid.  Apparently no reason to do this
in userland, we could just as well set these in the kernel.  Except
for possible backward compatibility problems for things not using the
helper.

BUT if the mount is unprivileged or it's a userns mount, or anything
previously not possible, then we are not constrained by the backward
compatibility issues, and can go with the saner solution.

Does that not make sense?

What's missing?

Thanks,
