Hi Casey

The assignment happens at the inode's initialization time and depends on
the behavior configured for a specific filesystem.
The SELinux reference policy actually configures static labeling for inodes
in the eCryptfs filesystem while for example allows ext4 inodes to be
initialized using extended attributes.

Ok, probably i have to go more in deep to explain how access control is
performed on eCryptfs. I'm talking for the SELinux's case, so SELinux experts
can correct me if i'm wrong.

First, i want to use extended attributes to initialize an eCryptfs inode, so
both the upper and the lower inodes have the same security context
because eCryptfs calls the *xattr() methods of the underlying filesystem.

Then, the process A accesses the eCryptfs inode 'I'. On the upper layer access
control is performed using the credentials of the 'current' process and the
security context of I.

If the process is allowed to access the upper inode, eCryptfs opens the lower
inode, presenting its own credentials with the type 'kernel_t'. Then, SELinux
checks if 'kernel_t' can access the inode with the security context of 'I'. If so,
eCryptfs obtains a file descriptor which, in this patch set, is labeled using the
same credentials it provided at open time and binds it to the upper inode.

Suppose for a moment that A is working on the eCryptfs inode 'I' and the process
B requests the same inode. ECryptfs uses the already opened file descriptor and
B will be granted to open the requested inode if:

- B has the 'open' permission on the upper inode 'I';


and can perform read/write operations if:

- B has the 'read' and 'write' permissions on the upper inode 'I';
- B is allowed to use the file descriptor opened by eCryptfs ('kernel_t').
- B has the 'read' and 'write' permissions on the lower inode I;


What i miss to say in my previous email is that even if eCryptfs is granted
to access inodes in the lower filesystem with full privileges, user processes
still need the permission to deal with the lower inode, but the check on the
upper inode is sufficient because the security context is the same.
