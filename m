There are common, legitimate use cases which use exclusively NetLabel, 
exclusively labeled IPsec, and both.  A LSM stacking design that forces 
SELinux to only operate with XFRM (labeled IPsec) is wrong.  If you are giving 
admins the ability to selectively stack LSMs you should also allow them to 
selectively pick which non-shareable functionality they assign to each LSM.

I've remember hearing the same several years ago too, until we see patches it 
doesn't make sense to spend a lot of time worrying about what the AppArmor 
developers plan to support.  Regardless, if anything I think this only 
furthers the need to provide a mechanism to selectively assign non-shareable 
LSM functionality to individuals LSMs in a stacked scenario.

I disagree.  In some use cases SELinux is better served by XFRM, in others it 
is better served by NetLabel.  Once again, I think you need to focus on what 
is possible with the LSMs rather than a particular set of use cases which 
happen to make the LSM stacking project easier.

It would be nice if the AppArmor developers could share their plans - or have 
I missed them on the list?  My apologies if that is the case, a pointer would 
be helpful ...

Agreed.

True, that wasn't a fair comment for me to make - my apologies.

I disagree that the approach you are proposing is the one that should be 
adopted.  I am very much in favor of providing the ability to selectively 
assign non-shareable LSM features when stacking.  If you aren't able to create 
a mechanism to assign features when stacking, I think I would be more in favor 
of a "first come, first served" model (the first LSM gets whatever it wants, 
and each LSM stacked on top has to make do with what is left) over what you 
are currently proposing.

Hmm, interesting ... not sure what I think of this.

Ungh, no.

Can you elaborate on this?  I can think of a few different meanings here ...

Obviously ideal, but unlikely to happen unless the netdev crew change their 
mind on blobs in sk_buff.

I'll be sure to take a closer look then.  I should have taken a closer look at 
your previous patches - my mistake and I'll take responsibility for that - but 
based on the discussion from the last security summit I was under the 
impression that stacking was only going to be allowed between "big" and 
"little" LSMs, that is obviously no longer the case.
