Sounds like your idea would present some a few problems.  To implement
this functionality user-space would have to take out a policy lock in
the kernel for an indefinite amount of time.  That brings up some issues
on scalability.  Typically atomic operations are small and fast.  This
also sounds like a toolchain issue.  The proposed functionality can be
done in the front end of semanage or setportcon.
