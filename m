NFS Daemon?  NFS quite often runs in the context of whichever process issued,
say, a read syscall.  It's at this point the cachefiles needs to run, and
using change_profile is I suspect not an option there.  Remember: you can't
change the objective profile of the aforementioned process, hence the act_as
pointer.

That said, I don't know what change_profile does.

I'm not sure what you're getting at.  The security NFS uses to access the
server is separate from the security that cachefiles uses to access the cache.

Okay.

Do what in userspace?  Parse the context?  Validate the context?  Or change
the context?

The cache aborts and all subsequent operations on that cache bounce and go to
the server instead.

The change of context cannot be done in userspace because to get to a
userspace capable of attempting this operation would itself require a change
of context.  Besides, it'd also be inefficient, probably horribly so, to do
all caching ops in userspace.

What I need is an LSM operation to change a task_security struct to have a
specified context.  I can then use the task_security struct in all future
cache ops on a cache by pointing task->act_as at it.
