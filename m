If the customization of the data is done in kernel then the kernel
can *first* verify the file's signature prior to doing any data
modification. If userspace does the modification then the signature
stuff won't work unless the tool will have access to the MOK and can
sign it pre-flight to the kernel selinuxfs.

You'd just have to implement a permissive model as we are with the
fw signing. No radical customizations, except one thing to note is
that on the fw signing side of things we're going to have the signature
of the file *detached* in separate file. I think what you're alluding
to is the issue of where that signature would be stuff in the SELinux
policy file and its correct that you'd need to address that. You could
just borrow the kernel's model and reader / sucker that strips out the
signature. Another possibility would be two files but then I guess
you'd need a trigger to annotate both are in place.
