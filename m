I am the maintainer of the Smack LSM. These patches do
not result in a system that passes Smack labels. I have
put some effort into tracking down why this is the case,
but have not yet been successful. The early theory that
the kernel server thread was not running with sufficient
privilege turned out to be a red herring. At this point
we don't know what the problem(s) is and more digging
will be required.
