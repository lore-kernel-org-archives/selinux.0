I believe if we chose we could walk the dentry tree under the root inode
and find all of these.

The dcache lock is valid.  Since the per filesystem dentry tree is just
a mirror of the filesystem data there is no advantage over using
the proc_dir_entry or ctl_table tree.  (If you start messing with mounts
that is another matter.

I hereby conclude this doesn't look easy enough to solve another way,
to get it solved in a timely manner.  Since the cost is only 2 lines
of code to use private inodes if we want to fix this later it should
not be difficult.
