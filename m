There are a bunch of libs that need to be installed for it to compile 
properly. Unfortunately there are new dependencies which have been added 
since I updated the wiki last. I unfortunately don't remember what they 
are. What I did to build it last time though was to apply the one patch 
onto the latest tag from the nfs-utils tree. Unfortunately I don't have 
a clean vm on hand at the moment so I can't manually go through and list 
all the packages for you. A heavy handed approach that should still work 
is that I can give you my rpm list from my VM and then you can just make 
sure you have all the devel packages installed. Another option would be 
to grab the nfs-utils srpm for fedora 17 and just add the patch into the 
spec file. That would work too and tell you the build dependencies you 
need. I could also just try to make that for you and put the RPM up but 
that wouldn't be for a few days at the earliest.
