We could remove this comment all together if you want. We're trying to 
indicate that at some point in the future there will be a label 
translation facility like idmapd but for labels instead. This is where 
the call would go if we had it. I had a basic version of the code a long 
time ago and that is where I had the call but there was way too much 
work to make it usable for now. Instead I just pass the null translation 
indicator on the wire and we wave our hands and say don't look at the 
man behind the curtain.

I'm pretty sure we can just remove that comment. It was a question from 
about 5 years ago now and I never found a compelling reason to say yes 
to it.
