I realize our last emails probably passed each other mid-flight, but hopefully 
it explains why we can't just pass packets when sk->sk_security is NULL.

Regardless, some quick comments below ...

I think I might replace the "check" boolean with a "kern/kernel" boolean so 
that in addition to the allocation we can also initialize the socket to 
SECINITSID_KERNEL/kernel_t here in the case when the boolean is set.  The only 
place that would set the boolean to true would be ip_send_unicast_reply(), all 
other callers would set it to false.

In the case of Smack, when the kernel boolean is true I think the right 
solution is to use smack_net_ambient.
