[I'm replying to both Stephen and Venkat here as the email is coming in
faster than I can type :)]

In the current non-secid world, if the connection is NetLabel labeled,
the sock_rcv_skb() LSM hook uses SECINITSID_NETMSG as the base_sid and
the recvfrom permission to control access.  Calls to getpeercon() on a
NetLabel connection use the socket's SID as the base_sid and the network
traffic's MLS label.

In the latest secid world, when there is only NetLabel labeling present
on the connection SECINITSID_NETMSG is used as the base_sid for the
final skb->secmark value as determined by the flow_in() LSM hook with
the MLS label being set to match the NetLabel on the packet.  Calls to
getpeercon() will use the secmark value of the packet when the
connection is establishes (in *all* cases) so getpeercon() in the
NetLabel only case will succeed and return the value determined above.
