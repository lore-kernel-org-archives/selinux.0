While I question the usefulness of a SELinux policy signature in the
general case, there are some situations where it might make sense,
e.g. embedded systems with no post-build customizations, and I'm not
opposed to added a signature to the policy file for that reason.
However, I haven't given any serious thought yet to how we would
structure the new blob format so as to support both signed/unsigned
policies as well as existing policies which predate any PKCS #7
changes.
