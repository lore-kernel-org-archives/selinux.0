I wonder what you mean by an inexact match here.

I would think not since we are already handling the more usual
"failure" of EACCES properly, and any other error would usually
have to be a near-fatal error concerning the whole LSM policy or
temporary memory pressure, for example. Usually the latter is auto
handled when the callers reattempt the llokup.

While it is theoretically possible
that the LSM might generate an error for the sub but not for the main,
we would have to first redefine the LSM hook to communicate this
differentiation. And at least in the case of the current user of LSM
(SELinux)
I don't currently see the need for this differentiation.
