My apologies, I should have been more clear.  What I meant to say is
that I have no objection to merging this patchset via the SELinux
tree, in principle.  If there are significant merge conflicts they
will need to be resolved first; I have no problem dealing with small
fixups as part of the merge process, but any substantial changes would
need a respin.  Also, while I haven't looked at this latest patchset,
I would still want to review it for obvious reasons, although having
discussed previous drafts in detail I don't expect to see anything
objectionable.

However, my biggest concern remains the lack of working tests; without
those this patchset doesn't get my ACK.  We need to have some basic
method of regression testing this, even if it does require IB
hardware, to have any hope of maintaining this long term.
