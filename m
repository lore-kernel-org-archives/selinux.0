You can already avoid that problem by building with make DESTDIR=~/out
install (which will then install libsepol.a under ~/out/usr/lib and use
it rather than the system one when linking subsequent libraries and
programs), so our current build procedure isn't broken, just the newly
proposed one.

I don't see that as a maintainable solution.  What other upstream
projects patch their Makefiles before release and thus ship a different
set of Makefiles than the ones they are using themselves for testing?
