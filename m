Hum. The intention of CAP_MAC_ADMIN was that it control the explicit
setting of the access control attributes used by the Smack LSM. I
personally prefer a single capability for the action over multiple
capabilities based on the objects involved. If you introduce
CAP_XATTR_SECURITY I would think that CAP_PROC_XATTR,
CAP_SVIPC_XATTR, CAP_NETWORK_XATTR, ... would follow in short order
and I hate the idea of having hundreds of capabilities. If you
must decouple the capability from MAC, how about a new name?
