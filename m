So possibly I'm missing something, but the situation with hijack seems
more exploitable than ptrace to me - you've created a hybrid task with
one foot in current's world (open files, tty, connection to parent,
executable) and one foot in the target's world (namespaces, uid/gid)
which can then be leveraged by other tasks within the target's
world/container as a way of breaking out of the container.  No?

Seems like you might be better off with a single operation for creating
a new task within a given namespace set / cgroup rather than trying to
handle multiple situations with different semantics / inheritance
behavior.  IOW, forget about hijacking a specific pid or picking a task
at random from a populated cgroup - just always initialize the state of
the newly created task in the same manner based solely on elements of
the caller's state and the cgroup's state.

I suspect that we want to continue in the parent's context, and then the
program can always use setfscreatecon() or exec a helper in a different
context if it wants to create files with contexts tailored to the
target.
