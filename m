No, but again there are only 3 kinds of state that I can think of
that are relevant at restart:

	1. calculations which were made before ckpt and after
	   restart.  For instance,  maybe before the policy change
	   the task could read key a but not key b.  After it could
	   read key b but not a.  With both keys, it can rule the
	   world.
	   In this case c/r changes nothing, bc the user could get
	   the same info using ptrace.

	2. system-wide changes which the task could do with the
	   old policy, while it could do different once after.
	   Doing both changes it can rule the world.
	   Again, c/r changes nothing, bc the user could simply
	   run the program twice to make both changes.
	
	3. resources (file descriptions, whatever) which the task
	   could create before the policy change but not after.
	   Every resource will be re-opened at sys_restart()
	   using the credentials of the caller.
	   This isn't perfect.  It means that if the program
	   started out privileged to open some file and then
	   dropped privilege, then the program either will fail
	   to restart, or will have to be restarted with extra
	   privilege.  And there's a decent chance that the
	   sys_restart() caller will have more privs than the
	   program anyway.  But that is why I feel pretty strongly
	   that it's up to the caller, in userspace, to worry about
	   it and do policy checks if need be.

I am more worried about a user taking a checkpoint image and
editing it, then pursuading a more privileged user to restart it
for him.  "see, the source was trustworthy and needed privs to
start.  can you restart it for me?"

The only thing to do about that is to eventually do TPM signing
of checkpoint images.

Again I claim that any state it couldn't get under the new policy,
either it could get using ptrace anyway (i.e. a key), or it can't
re-create the state because the new policy will prevent it.

And it still is re-starting under the new policy, though again
(I keep stressing bc this worries me more) the authorization
checks are done against the credentials at sys_restart(), not
the checkpointed credentials.

So do you think that adding a policy version check in the kernel
at restart would help this?

Do you think providing a recipe for userspace to do the policy
checks would help?  Along with a security_may_restart() hook
so that LSM policy can force restart to go through a helper
that does these checks, if it wants to enforce that?
