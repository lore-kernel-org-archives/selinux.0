For the moment I intend to add a patch on top of these adding two
security calls:

	security_may_checkpoint(ctx) which will authorize the
		ability to checkpoint at all, and
	security_write_checkpoint_hdr(ctx) will for now do nothing
		in any lsm, but will reserve a spot in the checkpoint
		header for an lsm-defined blob to write some policy
		info if it wants (i.e. a sha1sum of the policy).
		This way if it is decided that selinux or smack wants
		to do that, we won't need a change of the policy
		format.

It could query the lsm somehow (cat /smack/load | sha1sum?) and
store the result in a file sitting next to the checkpoint image.

Or, if we implement security_write_checkpoint_hdr() above, then
it could simply read the info out of the checkpoint file itself.

As for trusting user space tools to get it right, as it is
user space tools are required to get file labeling and policy
loads right.  So if we have the above two hooks, then selinux
could forbid any domain but restore_t from doing a sys_restart()
where the only program allowed to enter into restore_t does a
check for valid policy.  And/or, it could check at security_may_checkpoint()
to make sure that the context file is of type checkpoint_file_t,
where only an admin-approved /bin/checkpoint of type checkpoint_t
is allowed to create or write to files of type checkpoint_file_t.

Right, or you can just consider it migrating to a different
machine, where the different machine could be the same machine
after a lot of system and policy updates.
