I'd be inclined against adding CAP_SYS_ADMIN to the mask; note that it
is only checked for setting SELinux security contexts (or more broadly
any attributes in the security namespace) when SELinux is disabled.  In
the SELinux-enabled case, we are checking SELinux-specific permissions
when setting the SELinux attributes, whether on the client or the
server.
