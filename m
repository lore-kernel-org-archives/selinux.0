Possibly, during setup upon initial policy load (initiated by /sbin/init
these days) from selinux_complete_init, as early userspace may have
already been accessing them.

Walking the proc_dir_entry tree (or the ctl_table tree) is preferable as
it is a stable, user-immutable representation.  Also avoids taking the
dcache lock.

Right, they are all mapped to a single label presently.  I was thinking
of handling that from userspace after introducing a setxattr handler for
sysfs and a way to preserve the SID on the entry (likely caching it in
the sysfs_dirent and propagating that to the inode when the inode is
populated from the sysfs_dirent).  Then early userspace could walk sysfs
and apply finer-grained labeling from a configuration.
