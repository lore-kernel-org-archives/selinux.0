This sounds like a very spurious argument.  If the development is better 
done in userspace, then do it there.

There's no way to address all your security needs with an LSM in any case, 
for any practical system.  LSM is an API for making security decisions 
about kernel flow, usually as part of implementing access control 
mechanisms.  It is not meant to provide any kind of total security 
solution, and the argument that you can't do some security in userspace is 
totally illogical.

Development should be done in userspace unless it must be done in the 
kernel.

I'd say we need to see the actual use-case for Smack and Apparmor being 
used together, along with at least one major distro committing to support 
this.

Yama is special-cased and can stay that way.

SELinux and Tomoyo together makes no sense to me, and similarly, I would 
like to see the specific use-case for it and distro commitment to support 
it.

What is the UID issue and how does LSM stacking address it?

This is speculative.

If you're trying to say that only a few select individuals or orgs can 
configure things like SELinux and AppArmor properly, you're wrong, and the 
evidence for that is overwhelming.

Also, are you saying that security mechanisms are inherently easier to 
configure if they're composed from a variety of distinct modules vs. a 
monolithic scheme?
