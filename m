I thought the first message was enough to find the problem, but:

static void kauditd_send_multicast_skb(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
...
        nlmsg_multicast(sock, copy, 0, AUDIT_NLGRP_READLOG, GFP_KERNEL);
...
}

Since kauditd_send_multicast_skb() gets called in audit_log_end(), which
can come from any context (aka even a sleeping context) you can't use
GFP_KERNEL.  The audit_buffer know what context it should use.  So pass
that down and use that.
