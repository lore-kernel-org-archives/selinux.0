It may be that I'm misunderstanding TUNSETQUEUE and/or TUNSETIFF.  Can you 
elaborate as to why they should be different?

One thing that I think we probably should change is the relabelto/from 
permissions in the function above (selinux_tun_dev_attach()); in the case 
where the socket does not yet have a label, e.g. 'sksec->sid == 0', we should 
probably skip the relabel permissions since we want to assign the TUN device 
label regardless in this case.
