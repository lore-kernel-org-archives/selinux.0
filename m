Sorry, I meant CAP_SETFCAP.  Should it be added?

So it is.  I didn't realize that.

So if a non-selinux kernel is booted, then you think only the usual
DAC checks should be required to set selinux labels?

Or is this assuming EOPNOTSUPP were returned for setting
security.selinux xattrs in such a kernel?

Does anyone know what the trusted xattrs are used for?
