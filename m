It appears that netstat presently displays a "-" if it cannot obtain the
security context or pid/program name information, so perhaps you should
follow that convention whenever you cannot obtain a security context
regardless of the particular reason. Note that your logic shouldn't be
based on whether or not SELinux is enabled/disabled per se, but rather
based on whether the security module provides security contexts, which
can be determined by checking whether the secid is set to a non-zero
value by security_sk_getsecid().  The audit system (kernel/audit*.c)
uses similar logic to decide whether or not to log task security
contexts.
