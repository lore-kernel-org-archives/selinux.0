No. This is a baseless assumption. Granularity for the sake of
granularity is bad. Data General (a dead company) followed the
fine grained capability path and ended up with 330 capabilities.
Developers can't handle the granularity we already have (hell,
half of them don't know what mode bits are for) and making it
finer will only make it harder for them to make use of the ones
we have.

Does this demon do anything else that uses CAP_SYS_ADMIN?
If it has to have that anyway, it's not an argument for breaking
out the mount capability.

There is massive work going on elsewhere to allow containers to
mount without privilege. And I'm not at all interested in "might".

No, you'd be asking for CAP_SWAP for that. Swap control has nothing to do
with mounting filesystems.
