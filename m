Why?  Granted the TUN driver calls tun_attach() in both cases but that doesn't 
necessarily mean the operation from a security point of view is the same.  
Using the SELinux hooks as an example, attaching to an existing TUN device is 
currently treated as a relabel operation; the calling task relabels the 
persistent TUN device to match its own label so that traffic sent over the TUN 
device is labeled using the newly attached calling task's label.  Creating a 
new TUN device is like creating any other object (yes, there are exceptions to 
this but I'm speaking generally here), it inherits the label of the task which 
creates it, performing access control for a relabel operation here just 
doesn't make sense.

Or are you expecting some other form of access control for the attach hook 
which would change this argument?

Not that haven't already been mentioned.  If something doesn't make sense, let 
me know.

Not at present, the TUN driver only supports changing the user/group IDs.  I 
am debating adding support to change/view the label of the device/socket 
(TUN{SET,GET}SECCTX perhaps?) but that can happen later and is in no way 
prevented by these patches.  My thinking is that these patches are a 
requirement for us to apply the existing LSM network access controls to 
traffic originating from the TUN driver; depending on how use cases evolve 
with the TUN driver we may want to add additional functionality but this 
should serve as a good base.

Well, the only time this will really be an issue is when you have one task 
create a new, persistent TUN device and a second task that attaches to the 
existing TUN device and uses it to send traffic.  Sticking with your example, 
if the first task is labeled kvm_setup_t and the second task is labeled 
kvm_run_t then the policy would look something like this:

	# allow kvm_setup_t to create a new TUN device
	allow kvm_setup_t self:tun_socket { create };

	# allow kvm_run_t to use TUN devices created by kvm_setup_t
	allow kvm_run_t kvm_setup_t:tun_socket { relabelfrom };
	allow kvm_run_t self:tun_socket { relabelto };

The policy above has the nice effect of only allowing kvm_run_t to attach to 
existing TUN devices created by kvm_setup_t; it can not create a new TUN 
device or use persistent TUN devices created by other domains.  This should 
also help explain why I think calling the attach() hook after the 
post_create() hook makes little sense given the access controls currently 
proposed.
