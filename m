I'm happy to test this, but if you are curious, you can find the
selinux-testsuite at the link below; the "inet_socket" tests are the
ones relevant to this problem.

However, I believe there is a problem with this patch, see below.

The BUILD_BUG_ON() assertion no longer appears to be correct with this patch.
