Subject: [PATCH 04/10] MLSXFRM-v02: Add security sid to flowi
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Sender: owner-selinux@tycho.nsa.gov
List-Id: selinux@tycho.nsa.gov

This adds security to flow key for labeling of flows as also to allow for
making flow cache lookups based on the security label seemless.

+flowi structure:
+
+The secid member in the flow structure is used in LSMs (e.g. SELinux) to indicate
+the label of the flow. This label of the flow is currently used in selecting
+matching labeled xfrm(s).
+
+If this is an outbound flow, the label is derived from the socket, if any, or
+the incoming packet this flow is being generated as a response to (e.g. tcp
+resets, timewait ack, etc.). It is also conceivable that the label could be
+derived from other sources such as process context, device, etc., in special
+cases, as may be appropriate.
+
+If this is an inbound flow, the label is derived from the IPSec security
+associations, if any, used by the packet.
