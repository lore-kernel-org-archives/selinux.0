NOOOOO

libvirt is going in and changing fixed_disk_device_t:s0 to svirt_t:c0,c124

We do not want udev to see this and ask what label a device should have
if libvirtd_t created a chr_file in device_t.

I think either figure out if the device is newly created versus modified
or check the parent directory.
