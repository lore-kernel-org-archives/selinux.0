Theoretically, perhaps, but currently, no.

Each piece of documentation is included in the patch to which it applies.
Besides, I, like everyone else, always write full documentation for interfaces
that I add, so you should have expected it to be there, right? :-)

StGIT doesn't do that.  Besides, it's redundant information.  I'll add
something to the cover note that points out the documentation.

Which I am not allowed.  I have suggested it, and it has been refused.  The
problem, as I understand it, is that this would mean BIOs external to the
filesystem which the filesystem would need additional way of keeping track of.
You have to consider that a filesystem can't rearrange any bits of itself that
have I/O in progress on them.

Furthermore, a BIO may not be appropriate.  Consider ReiserFS's tail packing,
or consider an encrypted filesystem, or, worse, a compressed filesystem.  Also,
what if the filesystem isn't backed by a blockdev?

Have you looked at the horrible tangle of spaghetti that is the current Linux
direct I/O model?  It would take a lot of effort to refactor it.  I've made a
couple of attempts, but the assumptions it makes make it hard.

A separate, clean, in-kernel direct-IO thing would be an easier way to go - but
it's not actually necessary at the moment.

It will make very little difference to the code.  It would improve cachefiles's
cf-rdwr.c, yes, and it ought to improve performance.
