As unfortunately I don't have anything going into -rc1 I am working on
this right now.

Let me finish sorting out the sget_userns and mnt nodev mess and I will
push something out and then we can compare notes.  I think I have mqueue
covered by other changes.  As it is in the set of filesystems that
should just use sget_userns.

I am sorting through the nodev corner of this now.  It should just be a
day or two.
