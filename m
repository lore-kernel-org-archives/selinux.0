The NetLabel patch allows administrators to assign specific a CIPSO 
DOI/configuration to each LSM "domain".  Blindly using the CIPSO tag that the 
remote host sends could violate the administrator's NetLabel configuration.  

The current patch reads the CIPSO tag off the child socket, translating the 
tag according to the CIPSO DOI configuration to arrive at the correct/desired 
LSM  security attributes.  These LSM security attributes and the "domain" are 
then used to set the NetLabel on the socket.  In the case where everyone is 
well behaved this should have no effect on the socket IP options and the 
packets sent across the wire.  However, in the case of a not-nice remote host 
the outgoing CIPSO tag may change to match the administrators desired 
settings.

It is important to note that the next patchset will be based against David's 
net-2.6.19 git tree which has the additional LSM hooks in the accept code 
path - which I plan to use - so expect the implementation to change as a 
result.  Like I said earlier, these new LSM hooks are probably the proper way 
to do it, but I wanted to stick with the hooks that were present at the time 
I started working on NetLabel to minimize the impact on the kernel.
