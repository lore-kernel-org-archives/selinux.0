In most cases, they can extract the information directly from the policy
via seinfo or their favorite policy tool.  For mountpoint labeling, the
printk in question only tells them that mountpoint labeling was used,
not the specific option and value, so reading /proc/self/mounts is more
informative.  /proc/self/mounts will also tell them whether the
filesystem "supports" labeling via the seclabel option.  So I don't
believe it offers us any information that isn't available elsewhere.
