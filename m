Also, the labels on the overlay inodes change if you umount and then 
mount it again:

$ sudo umount merged
$ sudo mount -t overlay overlay -o 
lowerdir=lower,upperdir=upper,workdir=work merged
$ ls -ZR merged
merged:
  unconfined_u:object_r:work_t:s0 a  unconfined_u:object_r:upper_t:s0 c
  unconfined_u:object_r:work_t:s0 b

merged/b:
unconfined_u:object_r:work_t:s0 c

merged/b/c:

merged/c:

It seems to me that either the copied-up files should be labeled upper_t 
(i.e. from upperdir) or merged_t (i.e. from the overlay).  But certainly 
not lower_t (which is supposed to be read-only to the container) or 
work_t (which isn't supposed to be directly accessed by processes in the 
first place).
