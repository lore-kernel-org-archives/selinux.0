This loses how the connection was initiated, however. Packets that are
part of a connection that was initiated on the ftp port are different
from packets that are part of a connection initiated on the telnet port.
Now, the name_bind permissions will limit which domains can initiate
those connection, but my concern is that connection could, through error
or exploit, be passed to another domain that should not receive packets
from that type of connection (see below).

The use of a single related packet type loses the strong binding between
the connection type (determined on connection) and domains, most likely
because an established connection is passed to another process.

For example, for xinetd to work all of the xinetd children would be
allowed to receive all related packets (i.e., tracked_packet_t). This
means that if xinetd incorrectly passed, say, an ftp connection to
telnet it would still be allowed to receive those packets because they
would be of type tracked_packet_t. Labeling using something like
connmark seems to solve this problem. There may be other examples
relating to enforcing data separation based on other connection
information, like the network interface, but I haven't had a chance to
work through those scenarios.

Now you may be saying that it is not possible to determine with any
assurance that a related packet is related to, for example, a connection
that was initiated on the ftp port (and therefore given a different type
- related_ftp_packet_t - fixing my xinetd example). If this is the case,
your argument makes more sense to me.
