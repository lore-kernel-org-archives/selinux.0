Even triggered updates make sense, since you can at least have some form of trust
of where that binary policy came from.

Huh, not following? Perhaps, I am not following what your laying down here.

 Right now there is no signing on the selinux policy file. We should be able
to just use the firmware signing api's as is (I have not looked on linux-next yet)
to unpack the blob. In the case of falling back to loading an unsigned blob, we could do it ala kernel
module style. If it fails do to invalid format fall back to attempting to read it as a straight policy file.
If it fails on signature verification, we could still unpack it and pass it on. So you would want to 
be able to control if the signed unpacking from pkcs7 fails, whether or not its fatal.

We would also likely want to convey this state, the ability to change this setting to userspace in a 
Controlled fashion via selinuxfs. Ie I would want to know that I can load modules without valid signatures,
And that my current policy file is in fact invalid or valid.
