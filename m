 an alternative possible solution is to get the packet _out_ from
 the interrupt context and have the aux pid comm exe information added.

 as i understand it "a" possible way to do that would be to have a
 userspace ip_queue which simply marks the packet as "seen it" and then
 does "now please reprocess it".

 by the time that packets get to ip_queue in userspace, they will have
 had their aix pid comm exe info added (and the file sock stuff).

 alternatively, someone could spend a lot of their time doing exactly
 the same thing in kernel-space.
