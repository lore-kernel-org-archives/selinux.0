Okay, good.  That is my understanding.

Okay.

Unrelated question: why do the queues need to be disabled initially?  Is this 
to prevent traffic from being queued up?  Some other reason?  I'm just curious 
as to the reason ...

I still don't understand why in the multiqueue case libvirt doesn't just 
change it's effective UID/GID when creating the TUN device, or just use the 
TUNSETOWNER/TUNSETGROUP commands. This would solve the problem you describe 
above and - at least to me - seems like a better solution conceptually.

Help me understand why you believe that will not work.

Do you not want to give ownership of the TUN device to QEMU?  That would be 
the only reason I can think of, but all of your comments that I can recall 
have been about isolation between QEMU instances and not access control 
between a QEMU instance and its assigned TUN device.
