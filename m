That's unfortunate.  I'm _really_ not in favor of that, I would much rather 
see the non-shared LSM functionality assigned at the same time as the stacking 
order.  I'm not sure I'd NACK the current approach, or even if anyone would 
care that I did, but that is how I'm currently leaning with this split (build 
vs runtime) selection.

Well, if that is the case I think the first-come-first-served approach to the 
non-shared functionality probably makes the most sense.  I understand why it 
might not be ideal in ever situation but it is predictable.

Usefulness is paramount of course and quickness is nice, but I do think it 
takes a back seat to "the right solution".  We're all going to have to live 
with this f-o-r-e-v-e-r, or at least what will surely seem like it, so I'd 
much rather we take the time to make sure we beat out as much ugly as we can 
before it is merged.

Well, you can talk MLS labeled networking to both SELinux and Smack, and you 
can talk MLS labeled networking between SELinux and Smack already (hip, hip, 
hooray for commonly accepted standards!) so I'm not sure you need this.  
Although I suppose it might simplify the configuration in some cases or help 
if you're trying to migrate from one LSM to another.
