But it still requires the admin set it up that way, no? And aren't
privileges required to set up those devices in the first place?

I'm not saying that it wouldn't be a good idea to lock down the backing
stores for those types of devices too, just that it isn't something that
a regular user could exploit without an admin doing something to
facilitate it.
