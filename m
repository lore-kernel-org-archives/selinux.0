Sigh. So it's not only SELinux specific, but RedHat specific as well.

While neither is upstream you can certainly look at AppArmor and Smack,
both of which have nefarious plans for getting upstream.

It's been a long time since I dealt with file system cacheing, and
that was under Unix, and I don't claim to have a working understanding
of the internals of CacheFiles, but ...

I think that this is the point you should attack. Control the security
characteristics of the cache driver properly and you shouldn't need the
complexity that you're asking to introduce.

Can you run the cache as an independent thread and send it messages
rather than trying to do things in the context of the calling process?
I know that that involves extra bookkeeppingg, but it's lots safer.

Yes, and the SELinux semantics for what label to give a file don't
help much, either. The problem with the "act_as" interfaces is that
I wouldn't expect them to be any more reliable than the old access()
system call, which never really gave you a helpful answer.

Ideally you want to be running in the right context to create the
new file so that no one can use it and then label it "correctly"
and make it available.

That's by design.

The cache driver is a unique case with an unusual function. It's pretty
obvious that the kernel architecture, the VFS architecture, LSM, SELinux,
NFS and pretty much everyone else has given no thought whatever to the
implications of their designs on file system cacheing. For all concerned,
I'll say "sorry 'bout that".
