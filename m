The SETQUEUE/tun_socket:create_queue permissions do not yet exist in any 
released SELinux policy as we are just now adding them with this patchset.  
With current policies loaded into a kernel with this patchset applied the 
SETQUEUE/tun_socket:create_queue permission would be treated according to the 
policy's unknown permission setting.
