Subject: [PATCH 00/19] Support fuse mounts in user namespaces
Date: Wed,  2 Dec 2015 09:40:00 -0600

These patches implement support for mounting filesystems in user
namespaces using fuse. I've sent the full set of patches this time
because I feel that previous discussions could have benefited from more
context. I've also dropped any patches from my previous postings not
specifically required for fuse mounts.

These are based on the patches in the for-testing branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace.git,
but I've rebased them onto 4.4-rc3. I've pushed all of this to:

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sforshee/linux.git fuse-userns

The patches are organized into three high-level groups.

Patches 1-6 are related to security, adding restrictions for
unprivileged mounts and updating the LSMs as needed. Patches 1-2
(checking inode permissions for block device mounts) may not be strictly
necessary for fuseblk mounts since fuse doesn't do any IO on the block
device in the kernel, but it still seems like a good idea to fail the
mount if the user doesn't have the required permissions for the inode
(though this is a bit misleading with fuse since the mounts are done via
a suid-root helper).

Patches 7-15 update most of the vfs to translate ids correctly and deal
with inodes which may have invalid user/group ids. I've omitted patches
for anything not used by fuse - quota, fs freezing, some helper
functions, etc. - but if these are wanted for the sake of completeness I
can include them.

Patches 16-19 update fuse to deal with mounts from non-init pid and user
namespaces and enable mounting from user namespaces.

Thanks,
Seth
