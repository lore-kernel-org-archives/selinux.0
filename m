We need to call this function in the SELinux case.  So you'll need a
patch like the one attached (not even compiled but I think it is right)

What stops us from racing between the assignment of parent and it's
first use with a rename on our object and rmdir on the old parent?  I'm
wondering if we need to be doing this test holding dentry->d_lock (which
is what protects dentry->d_parent if I recall correctly)

Certainly doesn't fix all of the raciness, but I think it would close
the opps part.  Maybe someone who knows the VFS better can tell me if I
am misguided.
