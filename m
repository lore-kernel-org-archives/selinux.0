In the NFSv3 code, the workaround I've been using is to always allocate 
64k, but the correct way of doing this apparently is to use the page 
cache, as is used for ACLs and symlinks.

Yes, but we should not unnecessarily limit the network protocol when 
something is valid and possible in the local implementation (which is ~64k 
under Linux).

A security label include just about anything, e.g. an x509 certificate, or 
a base64 encoded image.

In the Linux implementation, if we can store a local label up to 64k, then 
we should try and ensure that it can be conveyed via NFS.
