I'm not sure I like the idea of trying to use "rdmaX".  It seems like this has
been a confusion point for things like drives and NICs in the past.  (Where the
order of device discovery is an issue.)

But I guess with more network types coming online we may have to have something
generic.

That said in the netdev world not all things are called eth0.  Some are called
wlanX, etc...

Does anyone know why do they have names based on network type?

So I could see where having a global "name" for a subnet would be nice...  But
isn't something like that called a domain name?  Does SELinux work in
conjunction with domain names in the netdev stack?

This may be a bit off topic but has anyone thought about adding GID specific
DNS record types?

I have experimented with just putting a GID in an IPv6 record and things I
tried work quite well.  Should we have a method to map a domain name to a
subnet prefix?

If the domain name mapped to a subnet prefix it would imply a set of port GIDs
on IB/OPA devices and if it mapped to an IPv4/v6 subnet it would be
iwarp/roce/usnic.

For this series and others the kernel could continue to use the correct
"subnet" information and user space could translate as appropriate?

Would this series work looking at a "subnet prefix" of an IPv6 address in RoCE?
