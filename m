Hi Paolo,

No problem, things get missed from time to time, especially when we
deal with things that cross subsystems.

The change in behavior for userspace makes me a little nervous as
there is no way of knowing how any random application may be coded.
Even if we are confident that the majority of applications set
IP_PASSSEC before calling bind(), we are likely still stuck with a few
that will break, and that means a lot of hard to debug problem
reports.

I would feel much more comfortable if we could preserve the existing behavior.
