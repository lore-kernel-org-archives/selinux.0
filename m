Well, I'm not really familiar with SELinux, I know a little bit about
how labels are applied in the netstack, but not that much...

The RDMA subsystem supports 4 different networking standards, and they
each have their own objects..

Just focusing on the pkey/vlan ideas. Every packet placed on the
network has either a pkey or vlan label, the networking switches and
receivers use these labels to create strong access control.

The labels are not-global, they are isolated to a site, or even a
single network within a site.

ipoib also uses pkey&vlan in the same way netdev does (with these
patches it looks like a userspace can still access a pkey via ipoib
even if selinux is restricting access to it).

Daniel's patch also touched on the QP1 and QP0 concepts. Packets can
be labeled as being for QP0/1 and the recievers process them under the
assumption they were sent by something with privilege (eg like the low
port numbers in IP)

So, from my perspective, we shouldn't be talking about doing pkey
without also addressing vlan. It sounds like Daniel's concern is how to
identify the number space (eg he is using a GID prefix for IB, which
won't work on anything else, maybe rdma device handle is a better choice)
