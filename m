Miklos, I have a question regarding renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE).
renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE) allows exchanging a directory and a non-directory,
doesn't it? If yes, TOMOYO and AppArmor got a regression bug described below.

TOMOYO and AppArmor handle pathnames of a directory and a non-directory
differently. It is considered as a directory's pathname if the pathname ends
with / , and it is considered as a non-directory's pathname if the pathname
does not end with / .

Until renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE) was introduced, if the old_dentry refers a
directory, it is guaranteed that the new_dentry will refer a directory upon
successful rename() operation. Therefore, TOMOYO and AppArmor automatically
appended / to the pathname calculated from new_dentry based on
S_ISDIR(old_dentry->d_inode->i_mode).

  int tomoyo_path2_perm(const u8 operation, struct path *path1,
                        struct path *path2)
  {
  (...snipped...)
          if (!tomoyo_get_realpath(&buf1, path1) ||
              !tomoyo_get_realpath(&buf2, path2))
                  goto out;
          switch (operation) {
                  struct dentry *dentry;
          case TOMOYO_TYPE_RENAME:
          case TOMOYO_TYPE_LINK:
                  dentry = path1->dentry;
                  if (!dentry->d_inode || !S_ISDIR(dentry->d_inode->i_mode))
                          break;
                  /* fall through */
          case TOMOYO_TYPE_PIVOT_ROOT:
                  tomoyo_add_slash(&buf1);
                  tomoyo_add_slash(&buf2);
                  break;
          }
  (...snipped...)
  }

  static int apparmor_path_rename(struct path *old_dir, struct dentry *old_dentry,
                                  struct path *new_dir, struct dentry *new_dentry)
  {
  (...snipped...)
                  struct path_cond cond = { old_dentry->d_inode->i_uid,
                                            old_dentry->d_inode->i_mode
                  };
  
                  error = aa_path_perm(OP_RENAME_SRC, profile, &old_path, 0,
                                       MAY_READ | AA_MAY_META_READ | MAY_WRITE |
                                       AA_MAY_META_WRITE | AA_MAY_DELETE,
                                       &cond);
                  if (!error)
                          error = aa_path_perm(OP_RENAME_DEST, profile, &new_path,
                                               0, MAY_WRITE | AA_MAY_META_WRITE |
                                               AA_MAY_CREATE, &cond);
  (...snipped...)
  }

Now, as renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE) is introduced, it is no longer guaranteed
that the new_dentry will refer a directory upon successful
renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE) because renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE) allows exchanging
a directory's pathname and a non-directory's pathname. TOMOYO and AppArmor can
no longer automatically append / to the pathname calculated from new_dentry
based on S_ISDIR(old_dentry->d_inode->i_mode).

To fix this problem, TOMOYO and AppArmor need to receive the flags argument and
use S_ISDIR(new_dentry->d_inode->i_mode) if renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE) and use
S_ISDIR(old_dentry->d_inode->i_mode) if renameat2(!RENAME_EXCHANGE).

Regarding TOMOYO, "[PATCH (for 3.15) 4/5] TOMOYO: Handle the rename flags." can
fix this problem. Regarding AppArmor, we need to update
"[PATCH (for 3.15) 3/5] AppArmor: Handle the rename flags.".

Anyway, James, can we merge
"[PATCH (for 3.15) 1/5] LSM: Pass the rename flags to each LSM module." now?
