I will fix bugs about static attacks.  That is, it's interesting to me
that a buggy file system (no matter how it is created), not cause the
kernel to crash --- and privilege escalation attacks tend to be
strongly related to those bugs where we're not doing strong enough
checking.

Protecting against a malicious user which changes the image under the
file system is a whole other kettle of fish.  I am not at all user you
can do this without completely sacrificing performance or making the
code impossible to maintain.  So my comments do *not* extend to
protecting against a malicious user who is changing the block device
underneath the kernel.

If you want to submit patches to make the kernel more robust against
these attacks, I'm certainly willing to look at the patches.  But I'm
certainly not guaranteeing that they will go in, and I'm certainly not
promising to fix all vulnerabilities that you might find that are
caused by a malicious block device.  Sorry, that's too much buying a
pig in a poke....
