Please add an LSM blob. Please do not use a secid. I am currently
battling with secids in my efforts for multiple LSM support.

Please! No secids!

I am going to be able to deal with secids for AF_INET only because 
SELinux prefers XFRM, Smack requires CIPSO, and AppArmor is going to
be willing to have networking be optional.

If you have two LSMs that use secids you are never going to have a
rational way to get the information for both into one secid.
