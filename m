I would expect that the operation would be more sophisticated
than that. You certainly aren't going to use what comes from
the other side without any processing, and I expect you'll have
some sort of operation on anything you pull from a config file
before you actually apply it.

Unless you've got an LSM other than SELinux, of course. If
cachefilesd is going to be responsible for maintaining this
magic context there needs to be an LSM interface for it, not
just an SELinux interface.

I think that I agree with Stephen, although I could be mirely confused.
That happens to me when interfaces are described in SELinux terms. I
still don't care much for multiple contexts, and I don't have a good
grasp of how you'll deal with Smack, or any LSM other than SELinux.
Just as Stephen mentions, I also don't see the generality that a change
of this magnitude really ought to provide.
