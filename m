Adding the LSM list to the thread.

Aside from the use of these objects requiring privilege,
what sort of controls do you think might be reasonable?
Who "owns" these objects? Can you have a coherent system
if one entity changes maps and another changes programs?
Why would "finer granularity" be better?

While I understand the issues with CAP_SYS_ADMIN being
uncomfortably general I am not the advocate of fine
grained controls that many of my peers and betters are.
Would the increased complexity add value? How?

You could put mode bits on your maps, programs, functions.
Do you otherwise treat these as objects, or are the more
like process state?

Just thinking out loud here, but if there is ownership on your
"objects" (objects have names, owners and access controls)
you could let the owner decide who gets to use them, just like
you do with user-space programs. This is kind of iffy for
programs that execute in the kernel, but you're already putting
a lot of trust in the eBPF implementation.

The big thing you need to do is define a security model, with
a list of subjects, objects and accesses. Once you have that
coming up with a basic access control policy is a matter of
creating something Linux-ish. The security modules will follow
on with their own interpretations of how to make it even better
in due course.
