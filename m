None of the LSM changes are intended to protect against attacks from
these sorts of attacks at all, so that's irrelevant.

As I said before, I'm also working to find holes up front. That plus a
commitment from the maintainer seems like a good start at least. What
bar would you set for a given filesystem to be considered "safe enough"?

That isn't the argument he made. I would summarize the argument as,
"Saying that X exposes an attack surface isn't by itself enough to
reject X, otherwise we wouldn't expose anything (such as example Y)."

You believe that the attack surface is too large, and that's
understandable. Is it your opinion that this is a fundamental problem
for an in-kernel filesystem driver, i.e. that we can never be confident
enough in an in-kernel filesystem parser to allow untrusted data? If
not, what would it take to establish a level of confidence that you
would be comfortable with?
