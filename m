Hmmm, so can VMware/VMCI-enabled guests send vmci_datagram packets directly 
into the kernel?  It isn't wrapped by things like AF_VSOCK?  If that is the 
case, then yes, we'll probably need to add a thin wrapper struct to carry the 
security label; similar to the control packets but not quite, as we have data 
to deal with unlike the control packets.  However, if vmci_datagram is an 
internal only structure, why not add the extra field?

Either way, we should be able to work around this, it would just be cleaner if 
we could add it to the datagram directly.

I maybe missing something here, but VMCI never leaves the physical host system 
correct?  It doesn't get tunneled over some external network does it?

Assuming it stays on the physical host system then we don't really care about 
a Windows host in this context do we?  From a guests point of view it doesn't 
really matter, the kernel handles all of the labeling and access control; the 
guests create their AF_VSOCKS as they normally would.

I think there is some confusion about VMCI - which is almost surely on my end 
- and what I'm trying to accomplish with the labeling, perhaps by answering 
the above questions you can help me gain a better understanding and we can 
sort things out.

Thanks.
