I'm still unable to understand.
"struct lsm_entry" != "the entire structure" ?

If I recall correctly, LSM framework was considered as "should be used by only
rule based access restriction mechanisms (so-called MAC)". Hooks for e.g.
antivirus modules should use different interfaces (e.g. fsnotify_open())
which do not offer ability to reject access requests synchronously.
I think that this technical barrier was removed by commit b1d9e6b0646d0e5e "LSM:
Switch to lists of hooks". But there still remains non-technical barrier.

We think that we should not merge similar modules which provide same functionality.
What about antivirus modules? They offer same functionality (intercept and judge
access requests) but interface details vary depending on userspace daemon which
performs actual scan. They cannot be unified, but we won't agree with merging
all product's all implementations. Do we change our mind and encourage antivirus
modules developers to try proposing for the mainline?

The patch James proposed looks like a placebo for me, for many of distributor
kernels will have to choose CONFIG_SECURITY_WRITABLE_HOOKS=y. If we offer a way to
call set_memory_ro()/set_memory_rw(), such distributor kernels will be able to
behave like CONFIG_SECURITY_WRITABLE_HOOKS=n.

Of course I mean with the rest of my changes in order to track list of LSMs.
pax_open_kernel() might be an interesting approach which will eliminate the need
of tracking list of LSMs.
