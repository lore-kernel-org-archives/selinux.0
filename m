Thanks for reviewing, Stephen.

Changed this to /sbin.

I'm testing a version which uses fixfiles, but it complains about
the fact that selinux is not loaded.  Using setfiles seemed
more robust.  So I guess I'll go back to that for now.  Someone
else can always update it later.

Done in my new version (which I'll send out once I re-create
it using setfiles again), along with most of your other
suggestions.

This (like the whole file) came from David, but nevertheless it's
something I've had to do many times to get a system booted.  Maybe the
new fedora initrd way of enabling selinux changes that, but it would
still be needed for older distros.

I was going to just explain how to do it in the documentation, but went
ahead and modified install_policy.sh to do it.

New version coming soon.
