Certainly some program domains lack permission to create ipc objects.
The ipc _alloc hooks are unusual in that they combine both allocation
and create checking unlike the rest of the object alloc hooks.  I think
that was discussed at the time, but people didn't want two different
hook calls at the same call site.
