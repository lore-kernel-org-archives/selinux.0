Yes, the skinware attack is the greatest vulnerability.

Even with that you're not eliminating the problem, you're just
making in (lots) more expensive to exploit.

Remember that we're looking at the behavior of arbitrary applications
here, and maybe the interactions between LSM defined behavior and
application defined security behavior.

If you are willing to trust the user space tools to get it right.
It gets things really complicated building trust relationships when
you have multiple policies to deal with. Look at the issues that
labeled NFS is trying to deal with. How would the user space program
know what the policy may have been when the process last ran?

I really don't know. As you're well aware, I've never bought
into the sophistication of the SELinux policy mechanism. One
of my major concerns has always been that the policy on two
machines may be different. With CR you have a case where the
policy on the same machine can be different over the life of
a process.

I am much less concerned with Smack because all the protection
it provides are subject/object relationships and those are
pretty straight forward. Even there, if the old rule set allowed
the process to read from a label the new rule set doesn't allow
you could get burned.

In the end, I don't suppose that anything stronger than "requires
privilege" is going to result in a system that's useful. So maybe
your best bet is security_may_restart(), and let the LSM decide.
Smack will most likely require CAP_MAC_ADMIN where as SELinux will
do a check based on the half-dozen contexts mentioned elsewhere.
I still don't think it is safe, but upon further reflection I'm
convinced that from a security standpoint it can never be safe to
do a restore. So we're debating one case, and a fringe one at that.

Let 'er rip.
