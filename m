Great, thanks.

Yes, just disregard my second paragraph above.

A few years ago I would have said that it is relatively uncommon for admins to 
enable the SELinux network access controls; it was typically just 
government/intelligence agencies who had very strict access control 
requirements and represented a small portion of SELinux users.  However, over 
the past few years I've been fielding more and more questions from admins/devs 
in the virtualization space who are interested in some of these capabilities; 
it isn't clear to me how many of these people are switching it on, but there 
is definitely more interest than I have seen in the past and the interested is 
centered around some rather common use cases.

So, to summarize, I don't know ;)

If you've got bigger sources of overhead, my opinion would be to go tackle 
those first.  Perhaps I can even find the time to work on the 
SELinux/netfilter stuff while you are off slaying the bigger dragons, no 
promises at the moment.
