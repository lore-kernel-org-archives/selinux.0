By specifying the subnet prefix along with the pkey value the user has flexibility to have different policy for different subnets, instead of a global PKey space that would require coordinating the partition configuration across all subnets.

Yes, a each subnet can have many partitions.  The partitions are contained within that subnet, a different subnet can have a partition that uses same PKey value, but that's a different partition.  So if we have 2 subnets, fe80:: and fe81:: they can each have a partition that uses PKey X but it doesn't mean nodes with access to that partition on 0xfe80 can reach nodes on 0xfe81 on that partition.

Subnets have one or more partitions.  Partitions belong to one subnet.

Going back to the example above assume fe80:: has a partition using PKey 0x8001 and we grant a user access.  Without the subnet prefix in the label we are granting that user the ability to use pkey 0x8001 on any partition available.  So subnet fe81:: can't use PKey 0x8001 if it doesn't want to grant that same user access.  By labeling with the subnet prefix we can grant access to PKey 0x8001 on subnet fe80:: only, leaving the subnet manager on fe81:: the ability to use that same PKey but not grant access to said user.
