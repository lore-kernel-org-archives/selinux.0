Hoping to minimize the burden of a single patch needing acceptance from multiple maintainers and synchronization problems that could create.  I could split this up and add the hooks where they are actually used if you don't think that's problem though.

OK, I can split this patch up and squash to the respective IB core patches where they are first used.
