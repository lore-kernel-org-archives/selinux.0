Hello Chuck,
   Thank you for the comments. I'll go through and address them inline
(Sorry for the top post).

I haven't run them through checkpatch in a while. I will make sure that
I do that soon and apply all of the style complaints from that.

Is it possible for kzalloc to fail with something other than NULL
though?

Thats a good point. I'll go through and clean these up.

We should free the structure regardless of server support. We moved to
this code a long time ago so I don't quite remember if we will ever see
an allocated label data structure when the server does not support
labeling.

I'm not sure about what James intends to do about NFSv3 security label
support but if it is what I think it might be then it is a different
beast than what I am doing for NFSv4. If anything James will probably
use the normal xattr method for security labels on NFSv3 because that is
the mechanism he is proposing. On NFSv3 this wont be a capability check
on the server for whether it supports security labels but instead would
be a capability check for if it supports xattrs (even then I don't think
it is since the xattr protocol is a sideband protocol).

Hmm I could have sworn I got this comment before and fixed it. I'll go
back and make sure that this is the case in the patches. Looking at
patch 7 alone it doesn't seem like we do this but I will go about
checking and fixing it just to be sure.

I don't believe this is the case. NFSv3 label support won't come in the
form of file attribute. Instead it will use James' out of band xattr
protocol. At that point the changes for getting the label into the inode
are very different. The reason we have to do all of this is because we
are getting the security label in NFSv4 from the fattr structure. This
structure contains what I'd call first class inode attributes. In Linux
security labels are handled through the xattr interface instead. Initial
I tried modifying the iattr structure which would have made it easier to
apply the fattr attributes to the inode including the security label.
This got pushback from Christoph since xattrs are the interface for
security labels. Also this wasn't a good solution because I needed a
dentry for the setxattr and getxattr calls and that wasn't available at
that point.

I can definitely rename them to be more generic. I don't see anything
else besides NFSv4 using them but its fine with me to rename them. The
reason we call them nfs4_label is because we modeled it after the NFSv4
acl support code. I spoke with Christoph a long time ago and he
suggested that it should be handled the same way that the NFSv4 ACLs are
handled as opposed to the iattr thing we were trying.

I don't think it is worth the effort. We are only using these structures
until the security label is crammed into the inode. Once that happens
they get freed. You shouldn't have them sitting around for very long.
They will be pulled again when the inode attributes expire and need to
be revalidated. For things like SELinux you could argue that the LSM
might benefit from this (and it might already do it but I'm not sure)
but I think that is something to be handled by the LSM itself or the
credentials code (since it already supports COW credentials it should be
possible).
