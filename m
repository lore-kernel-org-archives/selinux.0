Hi Richard,

Thanks for sticking with this, I really appreciate the effort you're
putting into this and I apologize it has taken me a few weeks to get
to reviewing this patchset ... comments below.

There is a push to convert the docs under Documentation/ to use the
reStructuredText format; from what I can tell this shouldn't have a
major impact on what you've already written, just a few formatting
tweaks.  If you can convert the SCTP/LSM/SELinux docs over to RST that
would be very nice.

I would probably avoid calling out specific source files in this
document as the code is almost certain to change at some point (moving
the LSM hook) and I can almost guarantee we'll forget to update this
document.  I think it's better to say something like this:

  "This new hook passes the @ep ..."

Once again, I must beg patience with my poor understanding of SCTP,
I'm quickly skimming through the RFCs but I'm sure to get some things
wrong.

Conceptually this is similar to selinux_inet_conn_request(), yes?
Setting the peer label of a new connection/association triggered by a
remote request.

I'm sure we'll get into this later once I get to the code itself, but
I wonder if we should be tracking the peer label in the endpoint?
Would we ever want to allow multiple different peer labels on a single
endpoint?  That seems a bit crazy to me.  Although it might just be
easier from an implementation perspective to reuse the existing
sksec->peer_sid field ...

This is possible because SCTP allows multiple associations per
endpoint, yes?  I imagine that most (all?) LSMs would want to restrict
this such that all associations for a given endpoint have the same
label.

Once again, the same logic as in
selinux_inet_conn_request()/selinux_conn_sid(), yes?

Presumably we don't need to do anything special for the
SCTP_CID_INIT_ACK case as this is the client side of the connection,
yes?

I would drop the filename and code details for the reasons mentioned above.

I'm guessing/hoping the reasons for multiplexing all of these
operations onto a single LSM hook will make sense when I get to the
code.

You can only "peeloff" a socket from a one-to-many socket, not a
one-to-one socket, yes?

(If I'm understanding SCTP correctly, it wouldn't make sense to have a
many-to-one socket, yes?)

I'm guessing there is no IETF/RFC guidance on using SCTP in a labeled
network environment?  I was just wondering if we should send a ICMP
error back to the other end of the association; I'm guessing we should
defer to the underlying protocol.  While CIPSO predates SCTP, it seems
in keeping with the CIPSO protocol that we would send an ICMP error,
however I imagine that with CALIPSO we would want to silently drop the
packet.

Same as above with respect to handling LSM denials.

We would only get here if this association was the first for a given
endpoint, yes?
