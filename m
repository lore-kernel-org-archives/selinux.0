And to be clear:  this patch fixes a real bug in the nfs/selinux
interaction on nohide mounts, a bug that needs to be fixed upstream as
soon as possible.  A bug that was introduced by changes in nfs, not
changes in selinux AFAIK, given that the original approach to context
mounts was introduced and approved by nfs folks long ago.  So regardless
of what happens wrt the text mount options, this patch needs to get
merged.
