Where does this assignment occur?

On this point I most strongly disagree.

The behavior of a filesystem and the data that it uses to determine
that behavior is wrought with complex interactions which may include
but are not limited to caching, read-aheads, garbage collection,
and various side effects of access control. If eCryptfs needs to go
mucking about with the data used by the underlying filesystem it is
not stacking properly. A stacked filesystem has no business whatever
changing the data of the underlying filesystem.

Excuse my ignorance for a moment. Is eCryptfs a user mode filesystem,
or in the kernel properly? The behavior makes it sound like the former
while the interfaces you're requesting make it seem like the latter.

I'm afraid to suggest this, but it looks as if you may be
able to solve your problems with some SELinux policy. I am
of course not an expert on SELinux policy, but it looks as
if not specifying an appropriate policy for the user space
component is what is in the way here.
