It isn't always that simple, see my earlier comments about
customization and manipulation by the policy loading tools.  Policy
signatures are nice, I support their addition, but I believe they will
only be useful for certain usage scenarios and not really usable for
general systems.

I haven't looked at the existing fw signing hook in any detail to be
able to comment on its use as a policy verification hook.  As long as
we preserve backwards compatibility and don't introduce a new
mechanism/API for loading SELinux policy I doubt I would have any
objections.

It seems like we could aim to do a bit better than try-and-see, but
once again, I haven't looked at yet in detail so I'll defer to you
judgement at this point.

That sounds reasonable to me.
