Hmmm.  How difficult would it be to enforce the order during LSM registration?  
As discussed previously, I'm not a big fan of assigning the network controls 
at compile time when the LSMs can be toggled at boot time.

The real solution is to just get the netdev folks to accept a security blob in 
the sk_buff so we can fix this (and many other problems) once and for all.  I 
still haven't given up on this effort but I think it would be silly to hold up 
the stacking effort for the sk_buff security blob.

The defaults are always going to be wrong for someone.

Well, maybe not ... I think.  If we take a FCFS approach to the network 
controls then only one LSM is really ever going to throw an error on the 
network hooks, yes?

I think the "excessively complicated" boat has already sailed :)

I'm still in favor of assigning the network hooks to the LSM at boot based on 
the "security=" configuration.
