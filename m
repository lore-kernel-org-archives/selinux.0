So how about changing eCryptfs (Goodness, but I hate camelCase) to
properly support extended attributes? That would seem a better
approach than mucking up the entire LSM. You still have to deal
with the SELinux policy, but I don't see you getting away without
doing something with that in any case.

OK, you could create your own xattr functions that do whatever credential
mucking they need to and then call the underlying file system's version.
It is possible that the work the NFS people have been doing for xattr
support (I haven't seen much on this lately, is it still active? Anyone?)
would prove instructive.

So eCryptfs provides its own process context. When you say "open" do you
mean open(2) or something else? A little precision goes a long way in these
discussions.

Why doesn't eCryptfs provide the credentials of 'I'? In the kernel you
can do what you will.

Right, but what I don't understand is why you can't use existing
mechanisms to achieve this? NFS manages (mostly).

I'll repeat the question because it matters.
