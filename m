Where we initialize the secmark should be immaterial from the NetLabel
point of view. The kernel mechanisms should assure that the IP option
reflects the MLS portion (or a label in the SA range) elsewhere. In any
case, a flow_out check doesn't make sense since the IP option and the
secmark are (should be) mirroring each other and there's in actuality
no "flow out" happening; they are just 2 representation of the SAME label.

Your suggestion as to adjusting the secmark per the IP option might be
fraught with danger since, in certain cases, I believe, you just return
the incoming options in the outgoing packet (timewait, openreq, etc.?),
and there's no assurance that that's a valid enough option that you can
retrieve a sid with it, correct?
