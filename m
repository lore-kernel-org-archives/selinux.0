One thing to keep in mind is that not only are SELinux policy files
distribution specific, they are machine specific as administrators
can, and do, customize the policy for their usage.  I really like the
idea of providing signed SELinux policies to the kernel but I question
how practical it will be for normal users/admins.

Some of the Machine Owner Key (MOK) work would likely be necessary for
signed SELinux policies to be even remotely practical.

Assuming I'm understanding the firmwareName attribute idea correctly,
we don't need to worry about that from a SELinux policy point of view.
As others have already stated, the kernel just reads a binary blob
that is pushed into it by userspace using securityfs.

See my earlier comments about SELinux policy customization.
