Definitely.  Apologies for not giving you much feedback earlier.

I had been hoping this was the kind of thing I could just double check
to be certain you weren't doing anything silly and just apply.  After my
last round of looking at this I realized that for me to be comfortable
with these patches I will have to give them very close scrutiny, and
check every detail.

Unfortunatly last cycle I had failed to budget enough time to give these
patches the close scrutiny they need.

>From a high level I am still very much in favor of this approach and
at least getting as far as safe unprivileged fuse mounts.

I have one or two little things to look at and then I hope to be going
through your patches one by one in detail.

Eric
