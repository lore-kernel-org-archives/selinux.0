So do you think it makes sense to have CAP_MAC_ADMIN and CAP_FOWNER
in CAP_FS_MASK?  In other words are you objecting to CAP_SYS_ADMIN
because of all of its other implications, or because you disagree
that labels for security modules should be treated as mere fs data
here?

I suspect that would create a LOT of bug reports.  Would requiring
CAP_MAC_ADMIN seem reasonable?

Which seems like all the more reason why CAP_SYS_ADMIN would need to
be added to the CAP_FS_MASK.  Or do you mean that check should also be
changed for something else?  (CAP_MAC_ADMIN, or some new CAP_FS_XATTR?)
