It's pretty cool.  In newer versions of netlabelctl I added an 
undocumented option to actually allow it to fix a sandwhich and do the 
dishes afterwards.  The exact command line option needed is left as an 
exercise for the reader :)

Great.  I'm not a debian user so I can't be of much help on the 
packaging side, but you can get raw tarballs from the NetLabel project 
site on SF (the current release is 0.19 which includes support for all 
the goodies in 2.6.28):

[NOTE: the rules/permissions you list above are the "newer" network_peer 
permissions which are likely not active unless you are running a custom 
SELinux policy as the default Reference Policy hasn't made the switch 
yet to the newer system]

The netlabelctl tool doesn't generate any allow rules, all it does is 
configure the NetLabel subsystem which is all that is necessary 
because, this is important, NetLabel doesn't actually do any network 
traffic enforcement.  NetLabel is a network labeling framework, which 
means that it only deals with setting labels on outbound network 
packets and retrieving labels from inbound network packets 
(the "netlabel unlbl accept on|off" option is a gray area).  The 
decision about wether to accept or reject inbound network traffic is 
left to the LSM (NetLabel supports both SELinux and Smack).  If you 
want I can go into more detail but it would probably be rather boring 
and not really provide you much in the way of answering your question.

Huh.  Just so I'm clear on this ... on the macbook you see avc denials 
that correspond to the allow rules you posted above, but on the dell 
you don't see the same avc denials?  Are you running the same SELinux 
policy on both systems (version numbers)?  What is the output of the 
following command on both systems?

 # cat /selinux/policy_capabilities/network_peer_controls

Well, like I said above, it shouldn't be a policy module or allow rule 
problem but I think you may be right in that the SELinux policy is a 
good place to start looking.  Compare the policy on the two systems to 
see if they are the same version and check to see if the new network 
peer controls are active (the cat command above; 0 is disabled, 1 is 
enabled).  Post what you find out.

Not sure linux-wireless will have much to do about this but you included 
the SELinux which is good, thank you.
