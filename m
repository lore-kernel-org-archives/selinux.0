Do have the ability to separate of secadm_r and sysadm_r? By allowing this, we 
will leak to a sysadmin that he is being audited by the security officer. In a 
lot of cases, they are one in the same person. But for others, they are not. I 
have a feeling this will cause problems for MLS systems.

Also, shouldn't we have an audit event for every attempt to connect to this 
socket? We really need to know where this information is getting leaked to.
