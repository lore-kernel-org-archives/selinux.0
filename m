Okay, that should make life easier.

Thanks for the extra information, but at this point I don't think the
exact format is important; I'm just trying to get a basic
understanding of what we might need to do.

Sigh.

So we've got RDMA over IB (does this have an acronym?  my googling
isn't showing anything ...), RoCEv1 which appears to be RDMA over
Ethernet (although it looks like it might still use an IP header?),
RoCEv2 which appears to be RDMA over UDP, and iWARP which seems to be
RDMA over TCP/SCTP.  Are there any others?

We've already talked about the RDMA/IB's pkeys and RoCEv1's GID/VLANs,
but RoCEv2 and iWARP are a little more interesting as they ride on top
of a routable network transport.  Do RoCEv2 and iWARP use the kernel's
stack, or is that off-loaded?  Actually, now that I think of it,
RoCEv2 and iWARP are probably implemented as userspace libraries
aren't they?  The kernel probably doesn't know or care about these
protocols at all, or does it?
