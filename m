It really isn't. net ports and service_ids are global things that do
not need machine-specific customizations while subnet prefix or device
name/port are both machine-local information.

docker and the like would seem to be the #1 user of this kind of
feature, it goes hand in hand with the ipoib namespace work that does
a similar (but less complete thing). This is a great way to create a
container and constrain it to a single pkey/vlan/ipoib device, which
would be the basic capability needed to sensibly rdma and containers
together.

This is why thinking about how to fully support the pkey/vlan concept
across all the rdma drivers seems so critical.

I'm surprised this isn't your use case. Again, I wish you'd think more
broadly before designing new uapis. selinux enabling the rdma
subsystem is a whole new uapi aspect for rdma that we have to live
with forever.

Converting the subnet prefix to a list of physical ports.
