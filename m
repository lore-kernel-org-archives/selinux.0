OK, let's do the math.

First off, it's 4 bytes, not 8. It replaces the secmark.
Your increased memory usage is going to be

	4 bytes/packet *  M packets/second * N seconds

Where M is the rate at which you're processing packets and
N is the length of time it takes to process a packet.

Let's pretend we have an embedded system that does nothing but send
128 byte packets on a 10Gb port. That's 10M packets/second. If it
takes a full second to process a packet the overhead is 40MB for that
second. I have it on good authority that packets can be processed
in considerably less time than that. The real number is more like
0.05 seconds. That means your actual overhead is more like 1MB.

These are dumbed down calculations. I am not a memory usage expert.
I am convinced that "real" calculations are going to get similar
numbers. I am, of course, willing to be swayed by evidence that I
am wrong.

Compare that to the overhead associated with using CIPSO on packets
that never leave the box.
