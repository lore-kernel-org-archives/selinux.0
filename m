I can definitely submit something like that as a stand alone patch and
then add our nfs4_label stuff to that instead.

How would you suggest going about doing that?

This should never be more than 4096. Under what circumstances would this
become a higher-order allocation?

Give me an idea of what you'd like it to look like and I can try to code
it up.

Ahh. Sorry that was a place holder for me. The idea is that in order to
allow for multiple models and policies we will have a deamon similar to
idmapd except to handle label translations. An example of this would be
if we have an SELinux box with an MLS policy and a FreeBSD box with
their MLS MAC module. If we want to ensure that they can both talk to
each other we have them agree ahead of time to a label format which is
just MLS label information. The translation daemon on the SELinux side
would take the label strip out the SELinux specific stuff and encode it
into the MLS label (probably a CALIPSO label) to send across the wire.
Then when the BSD box receives it they have their translation daemon
take the label convert it into something that makes sense to them
locally filling in whatever information they need outside of the MLS
label.

I don't think so. I'll go back and double check just to be safe.
