I didn't say that.  I said that LSM provides no standard way for
userspace to access the security infrastructure, at least beyond the
raw /proc/self/attr and xattr APIs, and I view that as a defect in LSM.
SELinux does have a userspace API, because we think there should be a
way for userspace to do that, and it is being used by userspace programs
outside of security tools.

All your code has to do is invoke a function provided by libselinux.  If
at some later time a liblsm is introduced that provides a common
front-end to a libselinux, libsmack, ..., then you can use that.  But it
doesn't exist today.   But it all just becomes a simple function call
regardless.

The point being that userspace is already using the SELinux API directly
- cachefilesd certainly won't be the first or most crucial application
to do so.

Well, he can speak to that.  But regardless, he isn't the maintainer.

You can certainly make the linking conditional at compile time based on
a build flag, and/or you can dlopen it at runtime and fall back
gracefully if not present.  It isn't tying your program to libselinux,
just using it if present, in this case to obtain an input to supply to
your kernel module so that the "policy" of deciding what context to use
is completely determined in userspace and not hardcoded at all into the
kernel.  If init and ls and ps can do it, cachefilesd can too.

I did express reservations about it, and I really don't think that this
is the main obstacle - the determination of the acting task security
label and how to set it is really only a small part of your patch set,
and considerably less disruptive than the rest of it.

That mostly works, but it means that an update to policy may require an
update to /etc/cachefilesd.conf, or that switching from one policy to
another might likewise require changing that file.  Versus using a
separate policy-provided config file for the label.

BTW, as should be obvious, some LSMs aren't label-based at all, so it
would need to be optional.
