It's not just IMA: the loadpin LSM needs an fd also (to tie back to dm-verity).

Totally agreed: nothing uses the usermode helper any more, so we
should ignore that moving forward.

Nope, this was all already done. The kexec loading interface was also
designed so that I could add an LSM hook for it without lots of work.

I can send a patch to add this; it should be trivial. :) (It's not
high on my TODO list at the moment just because Chrome OS doesn't use
kexec.)

Those syscalls were needed because the original ones were designed a
long time ago. :)

As long as the LSM know what kind of file it's loading, and has access
to the fd (and for IMA, the blob loaded from that fd), that should be
everything it needs. IMA has the name and blob, loadpin has the fd,
and a future signature-checking LSM could be able to look up signature
type from the load type, and split the key off (or fetch the key file)
itself.

If we expect to stack signature checkers, we can optimize the
signature parsing/loading infrastructure then. But since we have
neither the sigchecking LSM nor multiple ones, we can leave that to
later.
