The SELinux packet labeling that is done via iptables, Secmark, is different 
from the SELinux port labeling that is done via policy/semanage.  The key here 
is that iptables is used by SELinux to label packets, not ports.  This 
approach seems to be consistent with everything I know about iptables, but if 
I'm missing something please let me know.

This is something that has been discussed in the past, although perhaps in 
person and not on any mailing lists, but no one has done any serious work on 
it as far as I know.  As usual, we're always open to patches :)

I'm not really a SETroubleshoot or userspace guru, but I believe at least this 
part should be possible today ... although the change management 
infrastructure is left as an exercise for the reader :)

I'm pretty sure some of the audit dispatcher/plugin stuff allows for sending 
security events to a central repository for reporting, analysis and other 
nefarious purposes.

Sort of a "wash, rinse, repeat" of the previous issues.

I'll let the policy guys address this last bit ...
