How are you testing this?
I tried as follows:

# Make sure we have a policy that is using xattrs to label overlay inodes.
$ seinfo --fs_use | grep overlay
    fs_use_xattr overlay system_u:object_r:fs_t:s0

# Define some types for the different directories involved.
$ cat overlay.te
policy_module(overlay, 1.0)

type lower_t;
files_type(lower_t)

type upper_t;
files_type(upper_t)

type work_t;
files_type(work_t)

type merged_t;
files_type(merged_t)

$ make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile overlay.pp
$ sudo semodule -i overlay.pp

# Create and label the different directories involved.
$ mkdir lower upper work merged
$ chcon -t lower_t lower
$ chcon -t upper_t upper
$ chcon -t work_t work
$ chcon -t merged_t merged

# Populate lower
$ echo "lower" > lower/a
$ mkdir lower/b

# Mount overlay
$ sudo mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=lower,upperdir=upper,workdir=work merged

# Look at the merged dir and labels.
$ ls -Z merged
unconfined_u:object_r:lower_t:s0 a
unconfined_u:object_r:lower_t:s0 b

# Write/create some files/directories.
$ echo "foo" >> merged/a
$ mkdir merged/b/c
$ mkdir merged/c

# Look again.
$ ls -ZR merged
merged:
unconfined_u:object_r:lower_t:s0 a  unconfined_u:object_r:upper_t:s0 c
unconfined_u:object_r:lower_t:s0 b

merged/b:
unconfined_u:object_r:work_t:s0 c

merged/b/c:

$ ls -ZR upper
upper:
  unconfined_u:object_r:work_t:s0 a  unconfined_u:object_r:upper_t:s0 c
  unconfined_u:object_r:work_t:s0 b

upper/b:
unconfined_u:object_r:work_t:s0 c

upper/b/c:

Note that the copied-up file (a) and directory (b) are labeled lower_t 
in the overlay, but work_t in the upper dir, and neither of those is 
really what we want IIUC.

And that's just the labeling question.  Then there is the question of 
what permission checks were applied during those copy-up operations and 
whether the current process ends up needing write permissions to them all.
