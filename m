Okay I'll find a suitable kernel to build the next patch set

I'll split these into their own patches (looks like I'll end up with
netlabel patches as well to get CIPSO/CALIPSO working fully !!)

I'll stick to kernel language statements

I've now changed this to emulate your suggestion. However instead of
just setting peer_sid to first association I've added an avc check
because I have a case where the packet label was
"deny_assoc_sctp_peer_t" and allowed by peer recv, however this was not
in my "sctp_assoc_peers" attribute list. Checking with:
(allow sctp_assoc_peers self (sctp_socket (association)))
would have denied this as the first association.
Does this seem reasonable ???

Changed this to read "This will only be used by SCTP TCP type sockets
and peeled off connections"
