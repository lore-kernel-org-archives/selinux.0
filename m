It would have to include the port, but idea of using a device name for this is pretty ugly.  <subnet_prefix,pkey> makes it very easy to write a policy that can be deployed widely.  <device,port,pkey/vlan> could require many different policies depending on the configuration of each machine.

I've added Liran Liss, he devised the approach that's implemented.  This would be a pretty big change, with worse usability so I'd like to get his feedback.
