The set of LSMs, the order they are invoked, which LSM
uses /proc/.../attr/current and which LSM uses Netlabel,
XFRM and secmark are all determined by Kconfig. You can
specify a limited set of LSMs using security= at boot,
but not the networking configuration.

Tetsuo is lobbying for loadable security modules. I am
doing my best to leave everything in a state where some
soul braver than I might pick that up after I'm done.
I do not have any intention of supporting on the fly
or heuristically determined networking.

Ah. I want to create a useful system. I want to create it
reasonably short order. I am willing to forgo supporting
some configuration options to reduce the project time. In
particular, I hope to avoid mucking up other people's code
as that is a sure fire way to bog a project down.

It makes sense if you're in a network environment with heterogeneous
legacy multilevel secure systems and you want some of those machines
to talk to SELinux controlled processes and others to talk to Smack
controlled processes. That is unlikely to be an industry dominating
scenario.

That's one way to describe it. I'm striving to avoid it.
