Ifndef SECURITY this turns into (because security_sk_alloc is a static
inline in that case)

if (!sk->sk_security && 0)
        goto out;

Which I'd hope the compiler would optimize.  So that only leaves us
caring about the case there CONFIG_SECURITY is true.  In that case if
we need code which does if !alloc'd then alloc it seems we broke the
model of everything else in the code and added a branch needlessly.

Could we add a __init function which does the security_sk_alloc() in
the same file where we declared them?

I'm willing to accept that argument from an SELinux perspective.  I'd
also accept the argument that it is private and do something similar
to what we do with IS_PRIVATE on inodes.  Although sockets probably
don't have a good field to use...
