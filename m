As you will see in the patch descriptions below, the NetLabel LSM
category mappings are very badly broken.  This patchset should repair
things and make life better in the future.  The first three patches
are straight-up bug fixes; the fourth patch doesn't actually fix any
faulty logic in the code, but rather shortens some stupidly long
function and structure names relating to the NetLabel category
mappings.  I should probably do something similar with a lot of other
NetLabel APIs, but that is for another time.

Thanks to Christian Evans for pointing out one of the original
problems.  I don't think he realized how many problems there really
were, but I still owe him one for getting me to revisit this ugly,
nasty code.  I apologize it took so long to get a fix out and that
things were broken this badly in the first place.

Casey, I'm CC'ing you here because this patchset does touch some of
the Smack code, but as you can see the changes are trivial.  I will
be very surprised if you find anything objectionable in there.
However, if you do, let me know and I'll fix it.

DaveM/netdev folks, you guys are included here for the obvious reason
that a good chunk of the code changes live in net/*.  However, the
net/* related changes are all within the NetLabel code and not in the
core networking stack so I doubt this is something you'll care too
much about.  I'm going to guess that as far as you're concerned, this
is just another bugfix to a subsystem you don't really care about.

DaveM, unless you have any objections, I'm planning on pushing this
via the SELinux tree up through James' LSM tree since that seems to
make the most sense to me.  If you would rather push it via the netdev
tree please let me know.

-Paul
