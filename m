I'm not aware of any large scale use of SELinux+IMA, although it is
doubtful that IMA will be of use for protecting the SELinux policy
since it is written into the kernel, the kernel doesn't load it
directly.  There is also the issue that the SELinux userspace tends to
manipulate the policy such that the blob that is written into the
kernel isn't the same blob that is read from disk.

I imagine one could use IMA to protect the SELinux policy store, but
that isn't the same as protecting the binary security policy that is
written to the kernel.
