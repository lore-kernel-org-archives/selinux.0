Well, I continue to be dubious, but the hook does no harm so in case
it sounded otherwise, I don't object.

Mind you the right thing to do would be i.e. in the qemu case to have
a more privileged helper load the needed modules and then fire off a
qemu unable to cause module loads.  If userspace is willing to jump
through that rather minimal hoop then this could be useful I suppose.
