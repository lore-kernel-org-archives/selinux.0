Yes.

Not the tools, just the policy definitions.  Dan can help with that.
You add the definitions to the policy, then there is a script to
regenerate the SELinux kernel headers that #define the SECCLASS_ and
permission values.

It is just a way of carving up the permission space, typically based on
object type, but it can essentially be arbitrary.  The check in this
case seems specific to cachefiles since it is controlling an operation
on the /dev/cachefiles interface that only applies to cachefiles
internal operations, so making a cachefiles class seems reasonable.

If this was instead just a generic "set my acting context to <value>"
operation, then it could be a generic /proc/self/attr/active interface
with an generic implementation and permission check, but here we aren't
setting the active context of the cachefilesd daemon but rather of the
cachefiles kernel module.

The other approach that I suggested a long time ago is to exempt the
cachefiles kernel module internal operations from SELinux permission
checks altogether by setting some task flag when performing those
operations and checking for that flag either on entry to the security_
static inlines, similar to the inode private flag, or within SELinux
itself.  Rationale being that the cachefiles kernel module can already
do what it wants and the SELinux permission checks are really about
controlling what userspace can do.  Then we don't have to invent a
context for the kernel module at all or worry about subtle breakage when
some permission is missing from its policy.
