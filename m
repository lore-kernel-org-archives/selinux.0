As I understand it, the filesystem owns the options, not the security
module, so the filesystem has to know them all.  So yes, you'd just
define a flag for the context option and use that one for context=.  The
dummy module can then implement the security_set_mount_option() hook by
always returning -EINVAL so that it will reject any attempts to use that
option, and any other security modules can do likewise or can do so
selectively depending on whether they support the flag in question.

Although that hook should likely take an array so that you can pass all
of the security-related options as a single call, as they might need to
be considered together.
