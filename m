The classic solution to this problem for removable media are
uid=XXX and gid=XXX mount options.

I suspect a similar solution can apply here.

I don't think you need a solution that requires different kuids
to be able to write to the same filesystem uid.

For a files that can be accessed by more than a single user this is
fundamentally necessary.  Otherwise group permissions and acls can not
work.  They wind up as meaningless garbage, because without some kind of
synchronization those other users and groups simply can not be
represented.

If they are single users systems why should you need to?

But if permissions on files are going to be at all meaningful it is
a fundamentally a requirement that there be no confusion about which
party the other parties are talking about.  To the best of my knowledge
syncing uids/usernames between machines is as simple as it can get.
