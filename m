Seems like a logical way to do it.

Actually I missed mentioning the following under User API:

4. iptables contexts
   a. Specify labels with iptables rules.

Can't think of anything else being needed at this point in time.

Also, for the sake of the discussion, one "requirement" that some
may have is "Label-based routing", which would basically be a
polyinstantiated routing table. This is something TCS is currently
not interested in pursuing.

So, under USER REQUIREMENTS:

4. Routing support

	a. provision for a label-based routing mechanism (aka
polyinstantiated
	   routing table).
