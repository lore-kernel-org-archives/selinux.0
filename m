So what you envison is that when an MLS label is found on a packet using
NetLabel the MLS label from the packet is attached to the secmark
context (replacing the existing MLS label, if any) and the resulting
context would be checked for a "flow_in" permission, yes?

Assuming the permission is granted the packet's secmark is replaced with
the updated context.  This updated secmark context would then be used in
sock_rcv_skb() to make an access decision, yes?

It wasn't clear to me from your patch or the "master plan" what you
intended to do with the NetLabel context.  I thought the "/* See if
CIPSO can flow in thru the current secmark here */" comment in your
patch was rather cryptic.

Agreed.  Although to be honest, I think the NetLabel context can be
reconciled with the secmark and XFRM contexts just as easily using the
existing sock_rcv_skb() hook.  I guess I need to see where the
xfrm[4|6]_policy_check() hooks are called from in the stack to better
understand ...
