I think that would be preferable to CAP_SYS_ADMIN, yes.

Just to be clear, at present fsuid is irrelevant to setting the
security.* xattrs since it doesn't affect the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
at all, so it all depends on the initial capability state prior to using
setfsuid(), typically the full capability set.

Perhaps, although it isn't clear that this API is in use by anyone or in
use in a way that would actually distinguish based on individual
capability.

But if you were to add CAP_SYS_ADMIN to CAP_FS_MASK in order to ensure
that setfsuid() does in fact affect all filesystem accesses, how much
meaningful difference remains between fsuid==0 and euid==0?  It
obviously takes you far afield of only affecting filesystem accesses.
