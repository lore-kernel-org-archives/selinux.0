Anytime an EVM 'protected' xattr is created/modified/deleted, EVM needs
to be called to calculate and write the 'security.evm' hmac.  It looks
like the security_inode_setsecctx() hook is missing the EVM call.
Instead of writing the LSM label, immediately followed by the EVM label,
security_inode_init_security() creates the list of xattrs to be written.
Only then, it calls the fs to write them.  I would think that
security_inode_setsecctx() would need to do something similar.
