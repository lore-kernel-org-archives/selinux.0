No, sorry, sometimes I sound meaner than I really am. I meant that
sympathetically, honest. I don't think you should give up.

I haven't looked into the issues at all and I bet there are plenty,
maybe in audit and places outside of the security realm, but this
looks like a clean approach from the LSM interface standpoint. Do
you want the entire task or just task->security? I could see it
either way, but I suspect the task is your best bet. If you call
security_act_as() twice, then security_act_as_self() do you pop a
stack, or return to the initial state? How about security_act_as(NULL)
returning you to the initial state, and dropping security_act_as_self()?

Thank you for taking the effort to address the issues I raised.
I appreciate your willingness to accommodate my concerns even after
I'd flamed you.
