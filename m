[Resending because I sent it from the wrong identity.]

I think the point I'm trying to make is that we need to define the 
interface which if you implement it you are supported. For label 
import/export we have inode_{get,set,notify}secctx. For checking for 
xattr suitibility we have the new ismaclabel lsm call. Now the final 
thing we need to do is a call to determine if the lsm is suitable for 
Labeled NFS export meaning that it agrees to the semantics. Is 
inode{get,set,notify}_secctx and ismaclabel sufficient? I'm tempted to 
say we can make a call to inode_getsecctx and if it failes with 
EOPNOTSUPP we say we don't support it but then we need an initial file 
to call that on. This is why I'd rather have a LSM call that we can make 
that gives us a yes/no answer.
