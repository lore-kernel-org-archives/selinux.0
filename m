attr -S -g SMACK64 <path>

I would think that were it not for the case that access is denied
and I get an audit record for nfsd that reports a subject label of "_"
(which is correct for nfsd but not the process attempting access) and
an object label of "WhooHoo", which is correct. The server side
looks like it might be working right, given the information that it
has.

There's no full integration, but Ubuntu is easy to set up because they
compile in all the LSMs.
Set "security=smack" on the boot line in grub.cfg and reboot.

All processes and files will get the floor ("_") label unless you change
one. You can change
a file label with:
     # attr -S -s SMACK64 WhooHoo path
or execute at a different label with:
    # (echo WhooHoo > /proc/self/attr/current ; command)
