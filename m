Because for SELinux, for instance, when checkpointing a security
context for a task, we want to checkpoint the actual context,
the fscreate context, the sockcreate context, keycreate context,
and the task create (exec_create) context.

I know, I know,  I should come up with a better name.  But while
an selinux context would be

  root_u:root_r:root_t

the blob I have to checkpoint for a task would perhaps be

  root_u:root_r:root_t:::null:::null::null:::user_u:serge_r:serge_t:::null
