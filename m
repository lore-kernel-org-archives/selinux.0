They would correspond with the operations provided by
the /dev/cachefiles interface, at the granularity you want to support
distinctions to be made.  Could just be a single 'setcontext' permission
if that is all you want to control distinctly, or could be a permission
per operation.

In this case, I wouldn't expect a cachefiles object to act on anything
else.  Some objects are also used as subjects, especially in the
networking arena.

I was thinking the latter since the only goal was to control what
contexts could be set by a given task, but you could support per-cache
"objects" with their own labels (in which case the label would likely be
determined from the creating task).

If the latter, you don't really need a label for the object, and can
just use the supplied context/secid as the object of the permission
check, ala:
	rc = avc_has_perm(tsec->sid, secid, SECCLASS_CACHEFILES,
CACHEFILES__SETCONTEXT);

If the former, then you'd need more than one check, as you then have to
check whether the task can act on the cache in question, and then check
whether it can set the context for that cache to the specified value.
