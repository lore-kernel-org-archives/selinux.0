I'm CC'ing the LSM and netdev lists because there are some smart people 
there too that might want to comment on these proposed specifications.

Do you mean "MLS security classification"?  That "MLS" qualifier helps 
make it a bit more concrete and appears to match how you actually use 
it in the document.

I think you should either remove the "homogeneous" qualifier or change 
it to heterogeneous.  We've seen both different MLS implementations as 
well as MLS/Type-Enforcement implementations interoperate using IP 
options; granted it was with CIPSO and not RFC1108 but they are similar 
enough for this level of discussion.

This is an intersting point and the following argument may be a bit 
contentious, but arguably you could encode random security contexts 
into a traditional MLS security context; Smack is a shining example of 
this as it encodes the generic Smack label into a CIPSO permissive 
bitmap tag.  It may violate the spirit of the CIPSO specification but 
it is valid and provides a strong counterexample.

Further, the FIPS-188 specification, while not an IETF specification, 
does provide for a "freeform" IP option which is intended to support 
arbitrary security attributes.

Is one octet enough here?  I honestly don't have a good idea as to how 
much is enough, so a little justification of your choice (even if it 
only lives in email, not in the spec) would be welcome.

I'm also concerned with the implied convention of assigning one value to 
a particular implementation.  In the SELinux case, how do you deal with 
a non-MLS/MCS policy such as Gentoo/Ubuntu talking to a MLS/MCS policy 
such as Fedora/RHEL?  What about policies with different types?  
Differing numbers of MLS sensitivity levels or categories?

Also, can you explain the reason for having both a DOI and a algorithm 
field?  From an interoperability point of view, the node's security 
implementation is irrelevant as long as it agrees to abide by the rules 
and labels specified in the DOI.  I understand that currently a SELinux 
security label looks different from a traditional MLS/CMW security 
label, but there is no reason that a translation mechanism could not be 
implemented to provide a common network security label that could be 
understood and internalized by both types of systems.  While I'm not 
holding this up as a particularly good example in all cases, we do have 
something similar to this today in SELinux with how we handle the CIPSO 
protocol.

I'm being picky here, but it might be better to say "opaque bit field" 
just so we don't get into string encoding issues (is it UTF-8 or 
something else?).

See my comments in the next email about needing more text around how 
security enforcement must be handled by the different implementations.
