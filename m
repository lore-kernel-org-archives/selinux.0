	You know, that's starting to remind of this little gem of Borges:
http://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/language/johnWilkins.html
Especially the delightful (fake) quote contained in there:
[...] it is written that the animals are divided into:
	(a) belonging to the emperor,
	(b) embalmed,
	(c) tame,
	(d) sucking pigs,
	(e) sirens,
	(f) fabulous,
	(g) stray dogs,
	(h) included in the present classification,
	(i) frenzied,
	(j) innumerable,
	(k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush,
	(l) et cetera,
	(m) having just broken the water pitcher,
	(n) that from a long way off look like flies.
