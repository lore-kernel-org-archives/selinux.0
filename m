Why are these functions declared inline?  In any event, just let the
compiler figure out when to make them inline if appropriate.

I'm not sure why you can't enable this code yet.  From your comment, it
sounds like c/r doesn't yet handle the uid/euid in the fown_struct, but
that doesn't mean you can't manage the fown_sid that we store in the
file.  We just leveraged the fact that a fown_struct is never outside
the context of a containing struct file (at least from a send_sigio
context) to avoid introducing a separate security field with its own
lifecycle there.

Why are you using __u32 rather than just u32?  I think the former is
only necessary in certain headers that might be shared with userspace?

audit code was refactored in mainline to share common data structures
and code among security modules, so e.g. this became common_audit_data.
Not sure what your baseline is, but this happened in July.

osid is only used in kernel permission checks upon a SID transition, and
then it has been updated to ->sid prior to the transition.  Userspace
however may use it in a permission check (obtained via getprevcon) on
the caller when the program runs in its own domain, e.g. passwd(1).  I
suppose there should be a check for it, although possibly it could be
the same as for the ->sid (i.e. PROCESS__RESTORE).

Just FYI, this file goes away with the dynamic class/perm discovery
patch that I've been posting to selinux list.

Likewise, this file goes away and is replaced by an automatically
generated one from the new classmap.h file, which is the only kernel
file you'll need to modify to add new permissions.
