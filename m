I think a common helper is harder than it seems.  We need the parent dir in
one of the cases the helper has to consider, but finding it is done in three
different ways, depending on the caller:

 (1) dentry_init can just use ->d_parent as there's a lock held that prevents
     it changing (I think).  This could use (2) instead, however.

 (2) file_open has to use dget_parent().

 (3) inode_init doesn't have any dentries, but rather has the object and
     parent inodes.

If we don't mind file_open() always calling dget_parent(), then the common
helper can take the dir inode.

Also, thinking ahead to the possibility of bringing unionmount into the kernel
at some point: union non-dir dentries that are not yet copied up have no inode
attached, but rather fall through to the underlying lower inode in the VFS.
This, however, gives us nowhere to hang the inode label.  How expensive is the
security_transition_sid() call?
