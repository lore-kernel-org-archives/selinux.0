Why do the you have disjoint ID mappings for the users that are writing
to disk with the same ID?

I asked why the same disk users are assigned different kuids and the
only reason I have heard that LXD does this is the RLIMIT_NPROC problem.

Perhaps there is another reason.

In part this is why I am eager to hear peoples use case, and why I was
trying very hard to make certain we get the requirements.

I want the real requirements though and some thought, not just we did
this and it hurts.  Changning the uids on write is a very hard problem,
and not just in implementating it but also in maintaining and
understanding what is going on.
