I've been looking into this more and doing some testing.

As far as mounting goes, it ends up behaving as I expected. As long as
the user has permission to access the inode for the DM block device, the
device can be mounted. Access to the block devices behind the DM block
device is not required. I think this makes sense - it's consistent with
how read/write access to the DM block device works already independent
of user namespaces.

One thing I noticed that might be a concern (I'm not sure) are ioctls on
DM block devices. It looks to me like often these will be passed through
to the underlying block device.

It appears that all code paths which call dm_get_device originate with
ioctls on /dev/mapper/control. Doing this requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN, in
which case the permission check in lookup_bdev is skipped. So there's no
benefit to having dm_get_device pass a permission mask to
blkdev_get_by_path, nor is there any harm. It will only matter if at
some point userns-root is allowed to set up DM devices.
