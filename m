Actually, for overlayfs, I've made it such that the label off of the overlay
inode is used for the open file.  This label gets determined when the overlay
inode is set up and so is cached for the lifetime of the inode struct.  Like
this in the patch I posted:

+	if (inode) {
+		isec = inode->i_security;
+		fsec->union_isid = isec->sid;
+	} ...

where 'inode' is the overlay inode.  The subsequent bits:

+	} else if ((sbsec->flags & SE_SBINITIALIZED) &&
+		   (sbsec->behavior == SECURITY_FS_USE_MNTPOINT)) {
+		fsec->union_isid = sbsec->mntpoint_sid;
+	} else {
+		dir = dget_parent(union_path->dentry);
+		dsec = dir->d_inode->i_security;
+
+		rc = security_transition_sid(
+			tsec->sid, dsec->sid,
+			inode_mode_to_security_class(file_inode(file)->i_mode),
+			&union_path->dentry->d_name,
+			&fsec->union_isid);
+		dput(dir);
+		if (rc) {
+			printk(KERN_WARNING "%s:  "
+			       "security_transition_sid failed, rc=%d (name=%pD)\n",
+			       __func__, -rc, file);
+			return rc;
+		}
+	}

are for future unionmount support where there isn't an inode in the union
layer but only an inode in a lower layer.

In patch 7/7, if fsec->union_isid is non-zero in file_has_perm() then that is
used directly with avc_has_perm() in preference to calling inode_has_perm() on
the overlay or lower inodes.

Btw, is it correct that file operations must follow the label currently on the
inode rather than caching it in file_security_struct?

I'm hoping Eric Paris might address this.  As I understand it, we don't want
to give the container access to the lower layer labels, but would rather
consistently use the overlay labels.
