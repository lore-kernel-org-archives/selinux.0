Do we have any concern of a module being compiled against a new kernel
say with cap number 35 defined and then loaded into a kernel with only
34 capabilities?  Do we care about that forward compatibility?  If we
care BUG is scary.  EPERM would be the right thing since clearly on this
kernel the process can't possibly have cap #35.

We really have 4 options (in the order I like them).

1) do nothing (garbage in garbage out, sometimes panic sometimes not)
2) mask CAP_TO_INDEX (garbage in garbage out, no panic)
3) BUG_ON(!cap_valid(flag)) (garbage in BUG out, no panic)
4) WARN_ON/EPERM (garbage in EPERM out, no panic)

SELinux already sorta does #3 and #4 (we will panic if cap > 64 and will
EPERM between the max cap and 64) but I really don't like being blamed
when it's not my fault.  SELinux takes enough crap when people's systems
don't work and this time its clearly not my fault, which is why I'm
pushing this.

If we believe the capability system should take path's 1, 2, or 4 I'm
going to take path 4 in SELinux.  If capabilities wants to take path 3,
I'm ok with that too.  Its going to break a lot of people's machines I'm
afraid, but it would force ATI to fix their crap....
