Hello SELinux people, may I have your response?

Miklos Szeredi posted v3 of cross rename patchset at
http://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=138921924707564&w=4 . In that thread,
I questioned him whether he already explained this proposal to LSM people.
He answered no and explained me what renameat2() does. I asked him to get
confirmation from LSM people before he merges this change to linux-next.git
tree, and he answered that patch 07/11 already does what LSM people need. But
I commented that TOMOYO wants to avoid re-calculation of pathnames and posted
a patch at http://marc.info/?l=linux-security-module&m=138970469226106&w=4 and
John Johansen commented that the changes in AppArmor directory looks OK and
John would re-factor AppArmor to avoid re-calculation in the future. Therefore,
I posted a patch for SELinux/SMACK/Capability at
http://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=138973289404450&w=4 but Miklos responded
that he doesn't want to include my patch which temporarily breaks TOMOYO and
AppArmor. Instead, he asked me to post a complete patch right after his cross
rename patchset goes in. Thus, I was waiting for his cross rename patchset to
arrive at linux-next.git tree.

By the day Linux 3.14 was released, Miklos's cross rename patchset did not
arrive at linux-next.git tree. Therefore, I assumed that the cross rename
patchset will not go to Linux 3.15-rc1. However, the patchset committed after
Linux 3.14 release (commit da1ce067 "vfs: add cross-rename") directly went to
linux.git tree without letting it known to LSM people and the merge window for
Linux 3.15 was closed. Then, I noticed that renameat2() will be in 3.15 at
http://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=139789855823422&w=2 .

At first, I assumed that renameat2() is not callable as of 3.15 because I
couldn't find "#define __NR_renameat2" line. But Miklos told me that
renameat2() will be callable as of 3.15 because x86 automatically generates
__NR_renameat2 entries. I realized that TOMOYO and AppArmor now have a race
window (a kind of regression) introduced by the cross rename functionality, and
I re-posted my patch as a patchset in this thread. I can approve the changes in
TOMOYO directory and John Johansen already gave me a sort of Reviewed-by:
response to the changes in AppArmor directory in January's thread. In this
thread, Casey Schaufler gave me an Acked-by: response to the changes in SMACK
directory, but so far I have gotten no response from SELinux people.

Would somebody in SELinux community please respond to the changes in SELinux
directory so that we can merge this race window fix patchset before 3.15-final?

Regards.
