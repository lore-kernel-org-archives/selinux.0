And if that is the case then the capability flag does not get set in the
NFSv4 server caps and we don't use security label support on that mount.

No it should default back to being nfs_t which is what happens when I
use my client on an export that doesn't have security_label set.

We made sure it falls back properly. It was decided a long time ago with
discussion by several people that having it default to use it if its
there otherwise fall back to the old behavior makes much more sense to
an administrator.
