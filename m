Yes, I get that it is in an if-conditional; I probably should have
been more specific.  I was thinking of something more like this:

  if (len > 10)
    crc = ~crc(crc, option + 10, ...);
  else
    crc = ~crc;

... although now that I've typed it out, I'm not sure it's an
improvement.  I would just ignore me ;)

Thanks, that explains it.

I think there is value in verifying the checksum, but I completely
understand if the netdev folks don't want to pull in the CRC_CCITT
code, especially since currently only a few network drivers/protocols
pull it into the build.

DaveM, your thoughts?
