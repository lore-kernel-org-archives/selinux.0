Again thanks for taking a look, Stephen.

I think the LSM should handle things like sb_flags and sclass
automatically as the objects are restored.  Allowing them to be
specified in the checkpoint image only increases the number of ways in
which a corrupted checkpoint image can mess with the kernel.  (Note that
at the moment the restart code doesn't address mounts and it's undecide
whether that will be done manually in userspace, or done in the kernel
by the restart code).  As for seqno, see below.

Do I understand correctly that secids are supposed to be consistent
across machines and reboots, but not across policy versions?

There are several ways we could handle this.  One is to have
security_checkpoint_object() spit out an arbitrary void* which
describes the *full* security context, with the checkpoint/restart
layer completely unaware about the meaning of the contents.

Another is to have security_checkpoint_header() output the policy
version, and for each checkpointed object just write out an array
of secids.  If any file has a seqno which is not the same as the
rest of the container's, then refuse the checkpoint?

A third, which is what I was doing here, is to write out textual
context representations, and expect the LSM on _restore() to
know of a single meaningful interpretation for the context_str.
Maybe adding a security_checkpoint_header() at the top of the
checkpoint file would help with that (so that in the general case,
if policy version at restart is different from the checkpointed one,
we refuse restart, assuming that we can't meaningfully intepret
even system_u:object_r:user_file_t).

The secref is a reference to an object in the checkpoint/restart
object hashtable, not a secid.  Those are signed, with <0 meaning
error and 0 being a special case (in this case, 'not applicable')

If we write out the secids directly, which it sounds like you are
advocating, and not the secid_to_secctx string, then we can store
a u32 numsecs followed by __u32 secid[] which will have numsecs
entries.
