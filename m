No this was off list, however I've copied the relevant bits:

Can't see an usage for this one.

Also for these, considering we are not willing to go as deep as to only
allow these if within a given threshold. But still even then, sounds
like too much.

This one can be useful, for that privilege-dropping case.

Paul note: I later changed BINDX_ADDRS to just BINDX

But these, can't use an use-case.

The 2 above, can be useful.

But not these two..

No and no for the 2 above.

I would like you to be happy with this so I've added what I think is
some clarification.

The code that handles this is the selinux_sctp_assoc_request() in
hooks.c. If not the first association, then the other association peer
SIDs are validated to enforce consistency among the peer SIDs. However
what I recommend is that all peer labels should be the same. For
example:

Don't configure this (although valid):
netlabelctl unlbl add interface:lo address:127.0.0.0/8 \
    label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_lo_t:s0
netlabelctl unlbl add interface:wlp12s0 address:192.168.1.0/24 \
    label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_wlan_t:s0
netlabelctl unlbl add interface:enp9s0 address:193.168.1.0/24 \
    label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_eth_t:s0

As this is recommended:
netlabelctl unlbl add interface:lo address:127.0.0.0/8 \
    label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_t:s0
netlabelctl unlbl add interface:wlp12s0 address:192.168.1.0/24 \
    label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_t:s0
netlabelctl unlbl add interface:enp9s0 address:193.168.1.0/24 \
    label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_t:s0
