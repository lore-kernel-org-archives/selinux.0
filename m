That's unfortunate.  Prior attempt to address ioctl was here:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-security-module&m=113088357020104&w=2

Which led to the approach based on _IOC_DIR.

We could revisit that approach, or just give up and always check
FILE__IOCTL unconditionally. I don't think we want to go back to
interpreting ioctl commands in the hook, as it is a layering violation
and same ioctl command value could mean different things for different
underlying objects.
