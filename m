This patch introduces a new kernel feature designed to support labeled
networking protocols such as RIPSO and CIPSO.  These protocols are required to
interoperate with existing "trusted" operating systems such as Trusted Solaris.
I am posting the patch now not because I feel it is ready for inclusion into
any of the main kernel trees but because it is usable and I would like to
solicit comments from the community sooner rather than later.

I know there has been at least one previous effort to get CIPSO support into
the kernel and that was rejected.  I have tried to take the feedback from that
patch into consideration with this patch and create a new mechanism which
treads as lightly as possible on the core networking stack.  I have also
worked to make the new patch LSM agnostic so that this code can be shared
amongst multiple LSMs; while I am only providing a patch for SELinux at this
point I do understand that there is at least one other LSM that is interested
in making use of this new mechanism.

I understand that there will probably need to be a lengthy review period due
to the size and complexity of this patch.  I also understand that my relative
inexperience with submitting patches to the Linux kernel will not do much to
help my cause but I appreciate your patience and any comments you may have.

There is a more information as well as a basic userspace tool for configuration
of the NetLabel subsystem here:

Thanks.
