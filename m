> The network-control daemon (netd) creates and loads an eBPF object for
> network packet filtering and analysis. It passes the object FD to an
> unprivileged network monitor app (netmonitor), which is not allowed to
> create, modify or load eBPF objects, but is allowed to read the traffic
> stats from the map.

> Selinux could use these hooks to grant the following permissions:
> allow netd self:bpf_map { create read write};
> allow netmonitor netd:fd use;
> allow netmonitor netd:bpf_map read;
> 
> In this patch series, A file mode is added to bpf map to store the
> accessing mode. With this file mode flags, the map can be obtained read
> only, write only or read and write. With the help of this file mode,
> several security hooks can be added to the eBPF syscall implementations
> to do permissions checks. These LSM hooks are mainly focused on checking
> the process privileges before it obtains the fd for a specific bpf

> a general check hook is also implemented at the start of bpf syscalls so
> that each security module can have their own implementation on the reset

Series applied.
