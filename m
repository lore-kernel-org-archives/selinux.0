Yes, please commit patch 2/2 regardless as it fixes a bug which is not
dependent on any of the secid patches which are being discussed.  My
apologies for including it in the same patchset, I'll be sure to split
it up next time.

I'm trying :)  When I posted the NetLabel secid support patch last week
I asked Venkat if he could merge it with the main secid patchset (due to
size and dependencies that seemed like the most reasonable course of
action).  For reasons I'm not aware of he chose not to.  As a result I
keep posting updated patches backed against Venkat's latest and
incorporating the latest feedback.

Venkat, can you please merge the latest my latest NetLabel secid support
patch in with your next release?  If not, would you have a problem if I
pushed out a patchset which included your latest patches with the
NetLabel secid support patch and we used this patchset as the basis for
future work?
