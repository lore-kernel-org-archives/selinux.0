Unlike Casey, I don't think secids are a bad idea or just a holdover -
we find them to be quite useful and efficient in SELinux.  But in this
instance, he is correct that there is no reason to first fetch a secid
only to convert it into a context.  There are other cases where you do
in fact want to avoid generating and managing the life cycle of a
security context string until you truly need it, and thus a secid makes
sense.  So if you want to add a security_sk_getsecctx() hook, feel free.
There are some existing examples, e.g. security_inode_getsecctx() for
inodes, security_getprocattr() for tasks.  Note that they use a slightly
different interface than what you describe above.
