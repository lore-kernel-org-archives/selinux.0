Hard for me to argue on your priorities.

I will point out for others interested, userspace does usually need to
munge policy. It's typically only needed when the policy on disk is say
v35, the toolchain understands v35+ but the kernel only understands
v34. The userspace tools will downgrade the policy before it loads
shoves in the blob.  If the kernel understands v35 and the policy is
v35 you can (I think) actually use cat to load the policy.

So certainly this is a perfectly reasonable restriction on some
systems, but we have quite often run into user who don't update their
kernel but do update their userspace and any signing would be pretty
much impossible for them...
