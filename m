I'm not against that approach. How would you see it working?

The distro compiles in all the LSMs.
They specify that SELinux gets xfrm and secmark.
They specify the Smack gets Netlabel.
They tell (the new and improved) AppArmor to eschew networking.
They specify a boot order of "selinux,smack,apparmor,yama"
(They left off tomoyo for tax purposes).

On the boot line, the user types "security=apparmor".

What should happen?

Would you have the same opinion if SELinux were last,
instead of first? SELinux is the most feature rich of
the LSMs and no other LSM would ever get networking in
the presence of SELinux.

Agreed

If it drags on too long the boss gets cranky. And "labelled" NFSv4.2
gets done. And the list macros get reworked. And ....

If I had two years and didn't have to worry about anyone else's
changes and weren't beholden to retaining some of the past's more
interesting design choices I'd be more concerned about "right" than
"good".

Assuming it gets adopted. It will have to be good enough for that.
There is no guarantee on that.

I'm with you there. I just hope the ugly hasn't been lifting weights.

It's a nutty scenario. It would allow Smack and SELinux to divide the
hosts amongst them, and if SELinux wasn't going to use Netlabel for
on the box (127.0.0.1) communications anyway, Smack could use that
and be very happy.
