I would recommend avoiding the "TE" acronym as many in the IETF already 
associate TE with Traffic Engineering.  If you don't mind calling it 
Domain Type Enforcement you can probably get away with "DTE".

It has been may years since my last in-depth reading the IPsec drafts, 
and most of them have been outdated anyway, but from what I remember 
there was no explicit requirement that SAs be created in pairs 
(inbound/outbound).  While this is certainly the common case for 
connection based protocols such as TCP, there is no bi-directional 
requirement for most connectionless protocols such as UDP.

> Each instance of a security label will require an SA pair. 

Question for you ... using the current SELinux implementation as a 
reference, when firefox makes a request to an apache server over 
labeled IPsec, what are the resulting SAs?  I would think that a 
firefox_t SA is created to convey the request from firefox to apache 
and an apache_t SA is created to convery the response from apache to 
firefox.  Is that the case?

If so, each instance of a security label only requires a single SA.

Considering both connectionless protocols and the above example, always 
requiring two SAs for each label seems wasteful.

What happens in the case of traffic that is already explicitly labeled?  
Does the IPsec subsystem also apply an implicit IPsec label?  If so, is 
it derived from the explicit label?  What happens if the explicit label 
has a different DOI than what is configured in the SPD/SAD: 
translation, rejection, something else?

Just to clarify, this selector is only applied to outbound traffic, yes?  
The SPI and/or other network attributes still acts as the SA selector 
for inbound traffic, yes?

This last sentence should be modified to make it clear that the SPD/SAD 
configuration only controls the use of implicit IPsec based labeling, 
unless you are talking about a departure from the current SELinux 
implementation.

The recent trend in the IETF, especially around security, is to leave 
nothing to chance; ambiguity in the specifications tend to be frowned 
upon.  I think there needs to be a more in-depth discussion of how 
security enforcement MUST (I use this in the RFC sense of the word) 
operate.  Of course this will be a bit tricky considering the flexible 
and arbitrary nature of type enforcement, but I think it is important 
if you hope to have a consistent labeled IPsec implementation across 
multiple platforms.

This applies to all of the traffic processing and enforcement sections 
of this document.

Which IP address are you referring to, the source or destination?  Also, 
in the case of ESP tunnel mode, should the outer or inner IP header (or 
both) be checked?

Once again, much more detail is needed here regarding the security 
enforcement mechanisms used.

Same arguments as in the outbound case.

More explanation needed around how security policy is applied to traffic 
flowing through the gateway as well as how labeling is applied or 
removed based on network configuration.  This is way too vague for 
consistent implementations.

More detail about how to handle the negotiation would be an improvement,

I think you need to specify how this would work.
