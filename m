Yes. Finally.


I ran a series of micro-benchmarks on the assumption that
we're most concerned with system call performance. I used
lmbench, not because it's the world's greatest benchmark
but because it targets some of the things I care about.
I am perfectly happy to accept suggestions of other benchmarks,
but I make no guarantees that I'll be able to run them.

I ran sets of three runs for each configuration and tossed
any benchmark where I had too great a deviation. I ran one
set on Fedora 17 and another on Ubuntu 12.04. I ran what I
consider some interesting configurations, with both the old
LSM infrastructure and the stacking infrastructure.

I compared the performance for these configurations:

	CONFIG_SECURITY disabled
	CONFIG_SECURITY enabled, no LSM specified
	CONFIG_SECURITY enabled, SELinux enabled
	CONFIG_SECURITY enabled, SELinux and Yama enabled
	CONFIG_SECURITY enabled, Smack enabled
	CONFIG_SECURITY enabled, Smack and Yama enabled

I also ran SELinux + AppArmor + Yama, Smack + AppArmor + Yama
and Smack + AppArmor + TOMOYO + Yama under the stacking
framework, but as I can't run them without it I can't do
comparisons.

I found that with security disabled I got 0.79% worse
overall performance with Fedora but a 0.81% better overall
performance with Ubuntu. The combined was 0.01% better,
so I figure that the methodology looks OK.

On Fedora I found that for all comparable configurations
stacking added 1.23%. For Ubuntu, it was 0.61%.

I am no statistician, and I do not aspire to becoming one. 
I know that my methods were nowhere near clean and were
in fact very noisy. I had to disqualify a good number of
my results because the deviation between runs was too large.
