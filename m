Are you aware that loadable kernel modules used by antivirus software are used for
relaying events to userspace daemons? Such modules don't do scanning inside kernel.
Why such modules are considered as security risks?

Are you aware that SELinux (or AppArmor or whatever so-called MAC) is not always
enabled in all enterprise systems? Are you aware that there are systems where
administrators cannot afford using rule based access restriction mechanisms?
In such systems, the security benefits of loadable security modules (provided by
AV or alike) can outweigh read only LSM hooks.

This configuration option must not be set to N without big fat explanation
about implications of setting this option to N.

Honestly, I still don't like this option, regardless of whether SELinux
needs this option or not.
