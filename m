I am willing to accept that. I am willing to be
educated. I would be interested to see what the
"real" maths are, and how far off my dumb version
might actually be.

The reason we're told that there can't be a blob
pointer in the sk_buff is that it increases the size
of the sk_buff. Yes, it *is* about the size.

Which is a function of the size, no?

0xf8 + 0x4 = 0xfc
248 + 4 = 252

I don't see that with adding 4 bytes. Again, I'm willing to be
educated if I'm wrong.

Sorry, but I don't see what's insane with either the
current 248 byte sk_buff or a 252 byte sk_buff.

As always, I am willing to be educated.

Thank you.
