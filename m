Ok, but can we preserve existing behavior when packet are only being 
labeled internally?

(We should probably settle on the use of 'external' for cipso/xfrm 
labeling and 'internal' for iptables only).

Actually, don't worry about this.  The implementation can decide what a 
'null' mark might be and manage it themselves.

I'm talking about the code as a whole and the way this hook does not 
preserve existing behavior in the default case.

Look at the original code:

static void secmark_restore(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
        if (!skb->secmark) {
                u32 *connsecmark;
                enum ip_conntrack_info ctinfo;

                connsecmark = nf_ct_get_secmark(skb, &ctinfo);
                if (connsecmark && *connsecmark)
                        if (skb->secmark != *connsecmark)
                                skb->secmark = *connsecmark;
        }
}

Now, you have added an LSM hook in here:

+       /* Set secmark on inbound and filter it on outbound */
+       if (hooknum == NF_IP_POST_ROUTING || hooknum == NF_IP6_POST_ROUTING) {
+               if (!security_skb_netfilter_check(skb, secmark))
+                       return NF_DROP;
+       } else
+               if (skb->secmark != secmark)
+                       skb->secmark = secmark;

The dummy hook does not restore the secmark in the way that the original 
code does, now depending on the hooknum.

When LSM is not configured or no LSM module is active, the behavior of the 
code must be identical to the original version.

Ok, it's not pretty, but I guess it's much better than adding another 
field to the skb or similar.
