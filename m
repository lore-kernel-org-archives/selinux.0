Thank you for the feedback. The patch series is an RFC, so it's still
rough and not yet well tested in all possible scenarios.

Actually yes. The patch series itself is explicitly targeted at reducing
some overhead introduced by selinux in network loads (I'm sorry, now I
see that the last sentence in the cover letter is misleading), and it
tries to achieve that result without affecting others LSM users.

The first patch in the series just introduces an optional LSM hook
(netlbl_changed) that is invoked every time the
'netlabel_mgmt_protocount' values is changed. It do not modify the
behavior nor meaning of any of the existing hooks and/or netlabel APIs.
It's up to the security module to leverage (or not) the new one.

> Did you measure the impact that your changes have on Smack? 

Actually I didn't. This is one of the reasons I posted the patch as RFC.
As per design security modules not implementing 'netlbl_changed' should
not be affected. Am I missing something ?

Paolo
