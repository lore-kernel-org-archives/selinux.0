Sorry, I haven't had a chance to look at v6, but considering all our
discussions on the previous versions I don't expect any issues from
me.  I was hoping for some more generic hooks/controls, but that
doesn't look to be possible given the nature of RDMA.  I also want to
mention again the need for tests; we've talked about this in the past
and while it isn't possible to run the tests without IB hardware, I
would like to see us merge tests into the selinux-testsuite so that
those who do have the required h/w available could run the tests.

Assuming we can sort out the SELinux userspace and and tests by the
end of January, I see no reason why this couldn't go in for v4.11.
