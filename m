Doctor, it hurt when I do it...

IOW, the other option is to refuse attempting this insanity.  Fuse probably
can be handled, but being able to mount (with kernel-space drivera) an
arbitrary ext4 image is equivalent to being able to do anything and it's
going to stay that way for the forseeable future.  You are talking about
a large pile of code that deals with rather convoluted data structure,
had not been written with validation in mind *and* keeps being developed.
What's more, that code runs with maximal priveleges there are.

This is absolutely insane, no matter how much LSM snake oil you slatter on
the whole thing.  All of a sudden you are exposing a huge attack surface
in the place where it would hurt most and as the consolation we are offered
basically "Ted is willing to fix holes when they are found".

I know that security community tends to be less than sane, but this really
takes the damn cake.

Al, still not quite able to believe this is not a badly mistimed AFD posting...
