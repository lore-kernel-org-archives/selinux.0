All I'm saying is that it's simpler to mark the entire
structure than it is to mark parts.

There are too few beers on the table in front of me
to start that discussion. :)

I have to limit my comment on that to pointing out
that we can't make decisions based on code that has
never been proposed for the mainline.

We're not to the point where in-kernel modules are stacking fully.
Not everyone is on board for that, but hope springs eternal. Part
of the design criteria I'm working under is that it shouldn't
preclude loadable modules, and I still think that's doable. The
patch James proposed is completely compatible with this philosophy.
You can argue that it requires a loadable module configuration be
less "hardened", but the opponents of loadable modules say that is
inherent to loadable modules.

I don't understand what that would help without
the rest of your changes.
