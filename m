The initial use case is for netstat -Z so that it can reliably show the
security context of the socket rather than inferring it from the owning
process, which can be inaccurate for security-aware applications.

In your situation, when in != out, which would you rather see in netstat
-Z output?  Alternatively, if you want them both, perhaps you could
combine in and out into a single string that is returned, similar to
what you proposed for handling multiple xattrs with inode_getsecctx()?
