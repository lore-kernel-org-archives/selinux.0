This would mean that we have to maintain two APIs from now on.
This is something I really want to avoid because it is almost
impossible to get rid of the old one.

So this creates new incompatibilities what is another argument against
this approach. If you really need this, try to implement a full compat
layer. I think this is the only sane solution for this.
