Well, you save a branch and won't get the pagefault so it does 'fix' the
pagefault/panic from cap code.  It doesn't tell us when others screw up
and SELinux is still possibly going to BUG().  We are also going to
actually be returning a permission decision not on what was requested
but on something wholely different.

I like mine better, but I'm ok with yours and can just do my changes in
SELinux if this is how cap wants to handle it.  I don't really like the
idea of mutating the inputs and then making the security decision based
on that mutation rather than on the original inputs (and yes, I realize
that exactly what 2.6.24 was doing)

I'm not going to argue that the driver needs fixed and that is the real
problem.  I know its been filed with them and the response was that
there is no support for linux.  I have today tried to poke the path I
know of between Red Hat and them to ask them to take a look.
