In Smack, I'd expect that you'd want to apply a CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE check.
In SELinux, we'd apply a permission check between the task's security
context and the specified security context so that we can control the
pairwise relationship between them via allow rules and constraints.

The kernel has no way of knowing whether the context was determined by
cachefileselinuxcontext or not; it only knows that some task is trying
to write some value to /cachefiles/context or whatever the kernel
interface is, and it needs to apply some authorization check there,
where that check is security-module-specific.
