This is actually what I wanted to do, but based on a previous discussion
where I had suggested doing this (for a different reason) I came away
thinking you did not want it that way. So I'm happy with that change.

But if we do that it violates some of the assumptions of the patch to
rework MNT_NODEV on your testing branch (and also those behind patch 2
in this series). Something will need to be changed there to prevent a
regression in mount behavior when a user ns tries to mount without
MNT_NODEV when the mount inherited from its parent has it set.

Actually this is a more recent patch, so you possibly hadn't seen it
before.

That's fine with me.

Thanks,
