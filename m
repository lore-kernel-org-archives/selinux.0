I believe SMACK already works out of the box since we abstracted the 
call to obtain labels and your implementation currently works. The call 
that is needed is not secid_to_secctx but inode_getsecctx. You asked for 
this because SMACK labels can span multiple xattrs. I don't think its 
right to expect NFS to poke around the security structure to check if 
there is a valid hook(and it isn't really possible either). Maybe we can 
have an LSM hook where the LSM categorizes itself and returns a value 
and if the value it returns is label based then NFS can use it.
