The LSM infrastructure is 20 years old (or close too) and
as anyone who's raised a child can attest, what you expected
in the beginning is rarely what you end up with. We have some
really good implementations of MAC, but they have never been
the glint in the community's eye.

Security means so many things to so many people
(There are people who think queuing up for an hour
to get a body scan is an element of security.)
that restricting the LSM infrastructure to MAC seems
a bit arrogant. I am *not* saying that I support
allowing security modules that are nothing more than
interfaces for proprietary, out of tree mechanisms.
Those are evil. I would encourage an antivirus (or
time based access control, or content based denial)
to use the LSM infrastructure if it is all going upstream,
where it belongs.
