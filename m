Okay, based on your explanation of TUNSETQUEUE, the steps below are what I 
believe we need to do ... if you disagree speak up quickly please.

A. TUNSETIFF (new, non-persistent device)

[Allocate and initialize the tun_struct LSM state based on the calling 
process, use this state to label the TUN socket.]

1. Call security_tun_dev_create() which authorizes the action.
2. Call security_tun_dev_alloc_security() which allocates the tun_struct LSM 
blob and SELinux sets some internal blob state to record the label of the 
calling process.
3. Call security_tun_dev_attach() which sets the label of the TUN socket to 
match the label stored in the tun_struct LSM blob during A2.  No authorization 
is done at this point since the socket is new/unlabeled.

B. TUNSETIFF (existing, persistent device)

[Relabel the existing tun_struct LSM state based on the calling process, use
this state to label the TUN socket.]

1. Attempt to relabel/reset the tun_struct LSM blob from the currently stored 
value, set during A2, to the label of the current calling process. *** THIS IS 
NOT CURRENTLY DONE IN THE RFC PATCH ***
2. Call security_tun_dev_attach() which sets the label of the TUN socket to
match the label stored in the tun_struct LSM blob during B1. No authorization 
is done at this point since the socket is new/unlabeled.

C. TUNSETQUEUE

[Use the existing tun_struct LSM state to label the new TUN socket.]

1. Call security_tun_dev_attach() which sets the label of the TUN socket to 
match the label stored in the tun_struct LSM blob set during either A2 or B1.  
No authorization is done at this point since the socket is new/unlabeled.

Since you wrote that code will you be submitting a patch to fix that problem?

Unless I've missed something in your changes, the multiqueue code never calls 
any socket code which ends up calling {security,selinux}_socket_post_create(); 
I believe you only call sk_alloc() which ends up calling 
{security,selinux}_sk_alloc() which sets SECINITSID_UNLABELED (I mistakenly 
wrote 0 instead in my earlier email which is techincally SECSID_NULL).  Either 
way, I still think the logic I originally described above is correct.
