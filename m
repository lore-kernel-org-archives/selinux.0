The attached patches provide security support for unioned files where the
security involves an object-label-based LSM (such as SELinux) rather than a
path-based LSM.

[Note that a number of the bits that were in the original patch set are now
upstream and I've rebased on Casey's changes to the security hook system]

The patches can be broken down into two sets:

 (1) A patch to add LSM hooks to handle copy up of a file, including label
     determination/setting and xattr filtration and a patch to have
     overlayfs call the hooks during the copy-up procedure.

 (2) My SELinux implementations of these hooks.  I do three things:

     (a) Don't copy up SELinux xattrs from the lower file to the upper
     	 file.  It is assumed that the upper file will be created with the
     	 attrs we want or the selinux_inode_copy_up() hook will set it
     	 appropriately.

	 The reason there are two separate hooks here is that
	 selinux_inode_copy_up_xattr() might not ever be called if there
	 aren't actually any xattrs on the lower inode.

     (b) I try to derive a label to be used by file operations by, in order
     	 of preference: using the label on the union inode if there is one
     	 (the normal overlayfs case); using the override label set on the
     	 superblock, if provided; or trying to derive a new label by sid
     	 transition operation.

     (c) Using the label obtained in (b) in file_has_perm() rather than
     	 using the label on the lower inode.

Now the steps I have outlined in (b) and (c) seem to be at odds with what
Dan Walsh and Stephen Smalley want - but I'm not sure I follow what that
is, let alone how to do it:

	Wanted to bring back the original proposal.  Stephen suggested that
	we could change back to the MLS way of handling labels.

	In MCS we base the MCS label of content created by a process on the
	containing directory.  Which means that if a process running as
	s0:c1,c2 creates content in a directory labeled s0, it will get
	created as s0.

	In MLS if a process running as s0:c1,c2 creates content in a
	directory it labels it s0:c1,c2.  No matter what the label of the
	directory is.  (Well actually if the directory is not ranged the
	process will not be able to create the content.)

	We changed the default for MCS in Rawhide for about a week, when I
	realized this was a huge problem for containers sharing content.
	Currently if you want two containers to share the same volume
	mount, we label the content as svirt_sandbox_file_t:s0 If one
	process running as s0:c1,c2 creates content it gets created as s0,
	if the second container process is running as s0:c3,c4, it can
	still read/write the content.  If we changed the default the object
	would get created as s0:c1,c2 and process runing as s0:c3,c4 would
	be blocked.

	So I had it reverted back to the standard MCS Mode.

	If we could get the default to be MLS mode on COW file systems and
	MCS on Volumes, we would get the best of both worlds.
