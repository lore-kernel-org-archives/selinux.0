Well, it is possible that /bin/sh points to a non-bash shell but maybe 
not (I'm pretty sure the make command executes the scripts 
with /bin/sh).  Either way, I checked in the fix to the SVN tree 
earlier today so newer releases will have the fix; if needed I can 
release a 0.19.1 or similar but I want to wait and see how widespread 
the problem is ...
