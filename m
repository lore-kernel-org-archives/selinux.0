Right, the LSM hooks are used by LSMs, but also used by the integrity
subsystem, like here, to measure the file and verify the integrity of
the file.    

 int security_kernel_fw_from_file(struct file *file, char *buf, size_t size)
{
        int ret;

        ret = call_int_hook(kernel_fw_from_file, 0, file, buf, size);
        if (ret)
                return ret;
        return ima_fw_from_file(file, buf, size);
}

Distros build the initramfs on the target system, so the initramfs can't
come signed.  But for those systems that the initramfs can be signed, we
should be verifying it.

In addition, the files within the initramfs should be measured and
verified.   There isn't a need for a new hook, but for xattr support in
CPIO.  I started adding that support last winter -
http://lwn.net/Articles/630101/ .   Others have requested other changes,
not related to xattrs, before bumping the CPIO magic number.   There
should be a discussion as to what else needs to be done.

A measurement is a hash of the file which is stored in the measurement
list <securityfs>/ima/ascii_runtime_measurements and is used to extend
the TPM (eg. PCR 10).   The measurement list, in conjunction with a
quote of the TPM PCRs, can be used to remotely detect whether a system
has been compromised.

David Safford's white paper "An Overview of the Linux Integrity
subsystem" -
http://downloads.sf.net/project/linux-ima/linux-ima/Integrity_overview.pdf  goes into details of the different terms and concepts. (The IMA wiki is dated.) There's also a ic2e paper titled "Scalable Attestation: a step toward secure and trusted cloud".

Right, in those situations that the initramfs can be signed, it should
be verified.

I'm not real happy about it, but since we can't break the existing ABI
of loading data into the kernel via a buffer, a stop gap method of
signing and verifying a buffer would be needed.

Agreed
