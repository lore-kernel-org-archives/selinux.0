Here are the capabilities we currently give to sysadm_t with
sysadm_secadm    1.0.0    Disabled

   allow sysadm_t sysadm_t : capability { chown dac_override
dac_read_search fowner fsetid kill setgid setuid setpcap linux_immutable
net_bind_service net_broadcast net_admin net_raw ipc_lock ipc_owner
sys_rawio sys_chroot sys_ptrace sys_pacct sys_admin sys_boot sys_nice
sys_resource sys_time sys_tty_config mknod lease audit_write setfcap } ;
   allow sysadm_t sysadm_t : capability { setgid setuid sys_chroot }

   allow sysadm_t sysadm_t : capability2 { syslog block_suspend } ;

cap_audit_write might be a problem?
