The spec doesn't limit the size of a label but we thought that a page 
would be good. We can make it 4095 to ensure that it will always be in a 
page incase a null terminator is added. I believe someone mentioned this 
in the past I'm not sure why it didn't make its way in. We initially had 
something much larger but Trond chimed in and said that if its larger 
than a page something is wrong so we lowered it.

Its ok. It's been in the works so long its hard to keep track of it all.
