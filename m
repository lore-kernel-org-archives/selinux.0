Has anyone proposed any additional encapsulation patches which need additional 
fields in the sk_buff?  Are you aware of any additional encapsulation patches 
which are in progress?  When would you consider it "safe"?

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but these comments above only apply if we were 
to increase the size of the sk_buff struct, yes?  What I proposed, replacing 
"secmark" with a blob, does not currently change the size of the sk_buff 
struct so the performance and memory usage should remain unchanged as well.
