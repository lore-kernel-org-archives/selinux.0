I did not say there were not. I pointed out that historically C/R
has been used in the realm of mainframes and supercomputers. Because
it was developed in that space, the design reflects the needs of
that space. There are plenty of uses for C/R in a desktop environment.
The question is which of those constitute use, misuse, and abuse.

I hesitate to point out that this is hardly a desktop application.

Linux is more complicated than it needs to be. (smiley here)

Oh my, but you've introduced a lot of complexity. Requiring container
management is going to put the feature well out of reach of your
typical desktop user. And most importantly, how are "we" supposed to
figure out whether or not "we" would allow that? I know lots of
people who would allow C/R without blinking, and others who will only
allow it if you can demonstrate that the security state of the system
is unchanged between C and R, and  that the re-introduction of the
process will not affect the security state of the system. Goodness,
I suspect that getting Stephen and myself to agree on what would be
right for a system without an LSM would be close to impossible.

That's sort of throwing the puppy under the bus. You say that you
have to trust it as if it came from a stone tablet handed to you
by a burning bush, so if you don't trust it that much, don't do it.
This is very much the supercomputer mindset, and they use all sorts
of interesting techniques, including seriously restricted access, to
make that viable. It makes the feature unusable in the typical case.

File systems are lower risk, true enough, because their access policies
are pretty simple. The complex interactions between independently
defined application policies (I gave you a cookie two weeks ago when
I liked you, and now I don't, but you can use the cookie because even
though I disowned you and killed all your old processes, you can get
at my special resource because you restarted a checkpointed process.)
are going to give you grief.

Multiple containers are no more viable a solution than type enforcement,
simple separation, Bell & LaPadula or multiple virtual machines for the
general case. You have fallen into the isolation fallacy. Isolation is
easy, sharing is hard, and you don't have a restart if you can't share
the resources from before.
