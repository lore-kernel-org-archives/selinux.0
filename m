The thing is module signing is a policy built into the kernel, and as such
firmware signing is following that tradition as well. The way historically
module signing has evolved over time as LSMs have is through separate
frameworks as such naturally its only now we've started to consider module
signign through the eyes of a possible future core-LSM that others can stack
over. Even with this long term possibility its still a kernel policy. Other
similar functionality will natrally follow suit.

I see. Anyone doing that work?

That would be nice. I think you want a pretty board audience review. The
change in paradigm is pretty significant.
