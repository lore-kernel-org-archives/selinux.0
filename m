I can't comment on the LSPP compliance issue since the specific/proprietary
security target being used might really decide what's needed.

As for common user requirements, at least as I understand them, I would
look for the following in addition to this patch:

- Auto-labelling of child sockets for TCP (I am planning on sending a
separate
  patch out in the next few days).
- Using the label from the incoming packet while sending timewait
acknowledgements
  and other packets sent on behalf of kernel sockets.
- sid prioritization among the current mix of secmark, ipsec, and the
upcoming netlabel
- Replacing secmark on output with an access check in postrouting.
- localhost traffic handling with regard to labelling.

Resolved these should be, but given the fact that this patch doesn't
introduce this problem in the first place, and given the value it adds to
the
xfrm stuff, my hope would be for this patch to be treated separately. I am
hoping
for 2.6.18 if possible.

Sans label-based checks, no problem. But with label-enhanced checks in
place,
we need to have the label to use, which we don't since there's no real
socket present which normally provided the label. One way to handle
this would be to use the label on the incoming packet for the response
as mentioned earlier.

Primarily functional testing. Joy Latten at IBM is planning
on further testing this using the framework built for the original
work I believe.
