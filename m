At last year's LSS linux-integrity status update, I mentioned 6
measurement/appraisal gaps, kernel modules (linux-3.7), firmware
(linux-3.17), kexec, initramfs, eBPF/seccomp and policies, that have
been or need to be addressed.  Since then, a new kexec syscall, file
descriptor based, was upstreamed that appraises the image.  Until we can
preserve the measurement list across kexec, it doesn't make sense to
measure the image just to have it thrown away.  (skipping initramfs as
that isn't related to LSM hooks.)  Lastly, measuring/appraising policies
(eg. IMA, SELinux, Smack, iptables/ebtables) or any other files consumed
by the kernel.

Reading files from the kernel was frowned upon until recently.  So both
SELinux and IMA, not sure about Smack,  read the policy from userspace
into memory and pass it to the kernel.  The 'file' defined here is not
the policy itself, but the selinuxfs file.  'buf' contains the policy.
I'm obviously in favor of such a change, as it would allow us to both
measure and appraise the policy.

Instead of passing a buffer, the new syscalls are called with the file
descriptor.   This allows the file to be both measured and appraised.

Depending on the calling function, different validation requirements may
be desirable.  I would include the calling function (existing hook).
For example, IMA-appraisal permits files to be hashed or signed.
Depending on the calling function, a hash might be acceptable for some,
but all of the hooks.

Thank you for coordinating this.

I mentioned a few others above.
