I suppose. My point, which you may refute if it is incorrect,
is that there are common, legitimate SELinux configurations which
eschew Netlabel in favor of XFRM.

I am informed that labeled networking is being developed as an
option for AppArmor.

With those being the possibilities, the choice is pretty obvious.
(It's 3, just in case the reader is unfamiliar with the histories
involved)

It is reasonably easy to restrict Netlabel to a single LSM,
and since SELinux seems better served by XFRM in most configurations
and AppArmor intends to make networking an option that seems
like a viable strategy until Netlabel gets multiple LSM support.

That was my take as well. But, since only SELinux uses those currently,
and I see little pressure for Smack to support them I don't have
a lot of incentive in that direction.

Sorry if I presented my position poorly. I'm not trying to
gloss over details, and I apologize if I gave offense or made
statements that disrupted the harmony of the community.

Oh believe me, I have made serious effort. I just haven't made
significant progress. The good news is that there can be a
networking configuration (SELinux with XFRM, Smack with Netlabel,
AppArmor with none) that is both supported and rational.

Options I have considered include:
	- Netlabel support for discriminating LSM use by host,
	  just as it currently allows for unlabeled hosts.
	- Netlabel as an independent LSM. Lots of refactoring.
	- secid maps.
	- Remove secids completely in favor of blobs.

I should have an updated patch set by month's end. I think it
will address the current LSM issues. I don't know that I can
say it will address everything new LSMs might want to try.

Indeed. Thank you. A blob can contain sub-blobs. A secid is just
a number at the whim of an LSM.

Thanks. Sorry 'bout the whole "prefer" bruhaha.
