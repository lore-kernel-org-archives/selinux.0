When I wrote the new NFS/SELinux mount options code I was working under
the assumption that nfs_xdev_get_sb() would always give a new superblock
without the security struct initialized.  I now have a report of a user
in which we hit BUG_ON(newsbsec->initialized) indicating to me that NFS
is reusing a superblock.  The user says that he only has one mount to
the server in fstab, but doesn't know much about the server setup.  Is
it expected that nfs_xdev_get_sb might reuse a superblock?  If so maybe
we want this patch below?  Instead of me BUGing every time selinux sees
a reused superblock we but only if the reused superblock has different
security options than the old one.  I can't reproduce the issue so I
can't really test it....

comments?  should NFS be reusing a superblock here?  Can the NFS people
let me know how I can trigger it to make sure my patch fixes it?
