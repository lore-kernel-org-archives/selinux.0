I know about 5 patchsets that we are cooking. For 4 of them I think it
would be mostly fine, perhaps one conflict here and there. But the
other one is a refactoring on MTU handling and it touches lots of
places that 92c49e12646e4 ("sctp: Add ip option support") also
touched, like in the chunk below:

+++ b/include/net/sctp/sctp.h
@@ -441,9 +441,11 @@ static inline int sctp_list_single_entry(struct list_head *head)
 static inline int sctp_frag_point(const struct sctp_association *asoc, int pmtu)
 {
 	struct sctp_sock *sp = sctp_sk(asoc->base.sk);
+	struct sctp_af *af = sp->pf->af;
 	int frag = pmtu;
 
-	frag -= sp->pf->af->net_header_len;
+	frag -= af->ip_options_len(asoc->base.sk);
+	frag -= af->net_header_len;

In the refactor I'm removing this function from here and adding a
similar, not quite the same but similar, in a .c file. 

I post the mtu patchset as RFC next week so we can know better.
