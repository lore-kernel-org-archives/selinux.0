I apologize for not getting a chance to look at these patches sooner.
In general they look fine to me and my only real concern was addressed
by Pablo already (breaking userspace due to #define changes).

As far as exporting the 32bit secid/secmark to userspace, I think that
is a mistake.  James correctly points out that it does map to a LSM
specific value, e.g. SELinux and Smack security labels, but I don't
think he makes it clear that in the two LSMs that currently use secids
the mapping between the secid and the secctx is not constant; the secids
are transient values that will change with each boot in a manner that
userspace can not predict.  For this reason, I think exporting the
secids is only going to cause users/admins grief, whereas exporting the
associated secctx should be a much more stable value and is likely what
the user/admin is expecting anyway.
