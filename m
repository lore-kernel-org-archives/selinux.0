Hopefully the following thread addressed these concerns.

I will check for OUTPUT as well as POSTROUTING to kickoff skb_flow_out().

How do you envision this (i.e. resoring a null secmark) being useful?
secmark is anyway zero by default (when no labeling rules exist for the
connection) right?

Will do.

I am not getting this. This is a new function. Did you mean
to point to a different function?

Missed this as well (this is a new function in this patch). Please
elaborate.

Will fix this.

We could have done enforcement, in the SELinux postroute_last
hook for example, if only there were a place to hold onto the
"exit point context", separate from the label already associated
with the skb in the secmark field. postroute_last would need BOTH
the label of the skb (available in the secmark field) and the
"exit point context" to do enforcement.
