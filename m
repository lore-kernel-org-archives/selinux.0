A couple of potential short term workarounds have been identified,
but no one is happy with them for the long term. That does not
qualify as a "working fix" in engineering terms.

The short answer is "any security module that wants to".

And before we go any further, I'm a little surprised that
SELinux doesn't do this already.

Yes, and all of it's callers - to date - have had an appropriate
value of current. It is using the API in the way it is supposed to.
It is assuming a properly formed socket. You want to give it a
cobbled together partial socket structure without task context.
Your predecessor did not have this problem.
