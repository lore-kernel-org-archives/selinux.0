I only know a bit from the SELinux world and can't speak at all for any
other LSMs.  SELinux however needs the dentry when an inode first enters
core for a couple of reasons.  (once the inode is in core it should have
already been initialized and we skip all this)

If you have persistent xattr support we need the dentry since the xattr
code requires a dentry.  I have no idea why but that's what
inode->i_op->getxattr() requires.

Then we come to procfs.  In that filesystem we actually label based on
the pathname.  oh no did I say SELinux uses pathnames?  yes, I did, but
we only use the part of the pathname relative to the procfs root, so
really it's a static identifier which is immutable.

>From what I can see SELinux doesn't really care about the dentry, we
don't care about IS_ROOT() or the name or any of that crap (in the
non-procfs case).  All we really about is that if something can find an
inode and use it that security_d_instantiate() was called....

Calling security_d_instantiate() extra times is very low overhead and
not harmful.  the dirtiest (but easiest I guess) fix would be to add it
into the out_iput path as well.  I feel like there has to be an easier
solution, I'm just not sure what it is...
