Exactly because the mount options differ.

I don't have a problem if we have something sophisticated like nfs that
handles all of the hairy details and does not reuse a superblock unless the
mount options match.

What I have a problem with is the helper for ordinary filesystems that
are not as sophisticated as nfs that don't handle all of the option
magic and give userspace something different from what userspace asked
for.

It may take a little generalization of the definitions I proposed but it
still remains simple and straight forward.

CMD_THESE_MOUNT_OPTIONS_NO_SURPRISES
CMD_WHATEVER_ALREADY_EXISTS

Or we can make the filesystems more sophisticated when we move
them to the new API and perform the comparisons there.  I think
that is what David Howells is working on.
