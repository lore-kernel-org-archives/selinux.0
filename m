Perhaps I'm reading it the wrong way, but I didn't quite follow your
comment.  In an effort to bring some clarity to all of this here are all
of the possibile combinations that I can see using the code above (feel
free to correct me if I made a mistake):

 * SECMARK, XFRM, NetLabel present

   xfrm_sid = <full context from xfrm>
   loc_sid = <full context from secmark>
   nlbl_sid = <xfrm_sid te ctx, netlabel mls ctx>
   ext_sid = nlbl_sid
   final skb->secmark = avc_ok : ext_sid ? unchanged

 * SECMARK, XFRM present

   xfrm_sid = <full context from xfrm>
   loc_sid = <full context from secmark>
   nlbl_sid = SECSID_NULL/0
   ext_sid = xfrm_sid
   final skb->secmark = avc_ok : ext_sid ? unchanged

 * SECMARK, NetLabel present

   xfrm_sid = SECSID_NULL/0
   loc_sid = <full context from secmark>
   nlbl_sid = <secmark te ctx, netlabel mls ctx>
   ext_sid = nlbl_sid
   final skb->secmark = avc_ok : ext_sid ? unchanged

 * XFRM, NetLabel present

   xfrm_sid = <full context from xfrm>
   loc_sid = SECINITSID_NETMSG
   nlbl_sid = <xfrm_sid te ctx, netlabel mls ctx>
   ext_sid = nlbl_sid
   final skb->secmark = avc_ok : ext_sid ? unchanged

 * XFRM present

   xfrm_sid = <full context from xfrm>
   loc_sid = SECINITSID_NETMSG
   nlbl_sid = SECSID_NULL/0
   ext_sid = xfrm_sid
   final skb->secmark = avc_ok : ext_sid ? unchanged

 * NetLabel present

   xfrm_sid = SECSID_NULL/0
   loc_sid = SECSID_NULL/0
   nlbl_sid = <SECINITSID_NETMSG te ctx, netlabel mls ctx>
   ext_sid = nlbl_sid
   final skb->secmark = avc_ok : ext_sid ? unchanged

 * Nothing

   xfrm_sid = SECSID_NULL/0
   loc_sid = SECSID_NULL/0
   nlbl_sid = SECSID_NULL/0
   ext_sid = xfrm_sid
   final skb->secmark = avc_ok : ext_sid ? unchanged

I know the two of us have talked about this before on the mail lists,
but I don't believe anyone else has ever made a comment in this regard.
 I tend to feel rather strongly that when using just NetLabel on a
connection you shouldn't see an "unlabeled_t" type as I feel that the
connotation associated with this type is misleading, even though from a
TE point of view there may be an argument made that it is appropriate.

I agree - I'd like to hear what others (namely Stephen Smalley, James
Morris and all of the Tresys folks <past and present>) have to say on
this issue.
