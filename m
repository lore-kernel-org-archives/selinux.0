I couldn't think of a great way to make it smaller.  I certainly
understand....

EOPNOTSUPP seems like the right thing.  selinux=0 and mount nfs with
context=

I'd rather not rely on the FS to have to follow this convention.  Its
written so that num_opts=0 will work fine.

How should your example case be handled?  we can't store that context
information for later.  The only way we get here is through a direct
caller to set or clone from the FS since normally we would come through
superblock_doinit->try_context_mount->set_sb...->here and ss_initialized
would already have been taken care of.  Should I just dump the
superblock on the list to deal with later and not worry that I was given
mount options (doesn't seem like we have a good solution to your problem
now)?

I like an error code better, what fits?  It should be dealt with in
selinux_set_mnt_opts/sb_doinit and not here.  But still the question
remains.

We can't.  it is caught in both superblock_doinit and
selinux_set_sb_mnt_opts.

yes.  /me is quite embarrassed about that one...

This is actually where we need to point out the mount the same thing
with different options which you talk about at the bottom.  I'll check
this closely and make it a better message.

the variable declarations?  I guess I could.  They aren't used in many
other places, but having [4] randomly in the code is probably not the
best idea.

And it's just a couple lines.

I liked it as well because the NFS specific patch clearly shows the NFS
people that I pulled the ugly hack out.

comment doesn't belong.  I wasn't taking it and was still setting ->proc
here but realized it was a stupid idea.  Never removed the comment.

I pointed out where I think we need to do this, but what kind of error
do we want to return?  Do we actually want the mount command to fail?
