See attached.

These show a couple of things:

 (1) Dealing with lots of metadata slows things down a lot.  Note the result of
     looking and reading lots of small files with tar (the last result).  The
     NFS client has to both consult the NFS server *and* the cache.  Not only
     that, but any asynchronicity the cache may like to do is rendered
     ineffective by the fact tar wants to do a read on a file pretty much
     directly after opening it.

 (2) Getting metadata from the local disk fs is slower than pulling it across
     an unshared gigabit ethernet from a server that already has it in memory.

These points don't mean that fscache is no use, just that you have to consider
carefully whether it's of use to *you* given your particular situation, and
that depends on various factors.

Note that currently FS-Caching is disabled for individual NFS files opened for
writing as there's no way to handle the coherency problems thereby introduced.

			  ===========================
			  FS-CACHE FOR NFS BENCHMARKS
			  ===========================

 (*) The NFS client has a 1.86GHz Core2 Duo CPU and 1GB of RAM.

 (*) The NFS client has a Seagate ST380211AS 80GB 7200rpm SATA disk on an
     interface running in AHCI mode.  The chipset is an Intel G965.

 (*) A partition of approx 4.5GB is committed to caching, and is formatted as
     Ext3 with a blocksize of 4096 and directory indices.

 (*) The NFS client is using SELinux.

 (*) The NFS server is running an in-kernel NFSd, and has a 2.66GHz Core2 Duo
     CPU and 6GB of RAM.  The chipset is an Intel P965.

 (*) The NFS client is connected to the NFS server by Gigabit Ethernet.

 (*) The NFS mount is made with defaults for all options not relating to the
     cache:

	warthog:/warthog /warthog nfs
		rw,vers=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,
		retrans=2,sec=sys,fsc,addr=w.x.y.z 0 0

FEW BIG FILES TEST

Where:

 (*) The NFS server has two files:

	[root@andromeda ~]# ls -l /warthog/bigfile

	-rw-rw-r-- 1 4043 4041 209715200 2006-03-21 13:56 /warthog/biggerfile

     Both of which are in memory on the server in all cases.
