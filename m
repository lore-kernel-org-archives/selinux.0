It's not quite that distinct, the two solutions overlap in some areas but
neither can replace the other.

CIPSO would also be suitable for LSPP evaluation since it is capable of
exporting and importing labeled data. It requires a trusted network since
it doesn't encrypt or authenticate, so the evaluation would need to
restrict the environment accordingly.

The native IPSEC/xfrm approach is useful for more hostile environments
where you can't fully trust the network, but it's not interoperable with
existing deployed systems so it's not a replacement for CIPSO.

>From an evaluation point of view, either CIPSO or IPSEC/xfrm would be
able to meet LSPP requirements but with different restrictions on the
environment.
