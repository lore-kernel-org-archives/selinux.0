My opinion is that SELinux isn't for everyone; I think it would be
great if everyone enabled it, but I recognize that it isn't the best
fit for everyone's needs.  If users want to disable it in order to
better meet their needs, who am I to argue?

Or perhaps I should be upset?  I dunno, please tell me how I should
feel.  Like most people, I *love* when I'm told how I should react.

Once again, I suspect this all a matter of perspective; from my point
of view the SELinux code has compromised quite a lot, especially in
the case of the networking controls.

I think you've made your point known, and I believe I've been clear
about the reasoning behind my decision as well.  I would suggest we
leave it at that until/unless someone has something constructive to
add to the conversation.
