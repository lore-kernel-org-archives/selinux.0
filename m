Assuming there is a kernel bug which includes a null dereference that
bug may allow for a process to place information on the first page on
the system and get the kernel to act in unintended ways.  This patch
adds a new security check on mmap operations to see if the user is
attempting to mmap to low area of the address space.  The amount of
space protected is indicated by the new proc
tunable /proc/sys/kernel/mmap_protect_memory and defaults to 64k.
Setting this value to 0 will disable the checks allowing a system to
function exactly the way it does today.  This patch simply makes the
kernel more resilient in the face of future unknown null dereference
bugs.

The security checks is enforced in 2 places.  First in SELinux and also
in the dummy security function.  Doing the check in SELinux allows an
SELinux system to use its fine grained security properties to
selectively allow processes to still mmap the low pages page while
denying most processes that potentially sensitive operation.
Enforcement is also done in the dummy operation dummy_file_mmap() and
will be used for enforcement on non-selinux systems.  Although, on such
a system the proc tunable must be set to 0 if any applications actually
need to mmap to the low pages.  No fine grained security means it has to
be this all or nothing approach on non-selinux systems.

One result of using the dummy hook for non-selinux kernels means that I
can't leave the generic module stacking code in the SELinux check.  If
the secondary ops are called they will always deny the operation just
like in non-selinux systems even if SELinux policy would have allowed
the action.  This patch may be the first step to removing the arbitrary
LSM module stacking code from SELinux.  I think history has shown the
arbitrary module stacking is not a good idea and eventually I want to
pull out all the secondary calls which aren't used by the capability
module, so I view this as just the first step along those lines.

This patch uses a new SELinux security class "memprotect."  Policy
already contains a number of allow rules like  a_t self:process *
(unconfined_t being one of them) which mean that putting this check in
the process class (its best current fit) would make it useless as all
user processes, which we also want to protect against, would be allowed.
By taking the memprotect name of the new class it will also make it
possible for us to move some of the other memory protect permissions out
of 'process' and into the new class next time we bump the policy version
number (which I also think is a good future idea)
