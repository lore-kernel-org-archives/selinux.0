You're asking me?!  From my point of view that it is already unified.
The same mechanism used for appraising files in general could be used
for appraising those mentioned.  :) 

The main issue is having the file data and metadata (eg. signatures)
distributed together.  Thanks to Fionnula and Florian support for
including file signatures in rpm packages was released today -
http://lists.rpm.org/pipermail/rpm-maint/2015-September/003962.html.

> POST_SETATTR seems to be for inode_post_setxattr, so that as well?

No.  The IMA policy rules can be defined in terms of file metadata (eg.
uid).  Changing the file metadata might result in files that previously
weren't appraised, now need to be appraised.   The EVM security xattr is
an hmac of the file metadata.  So that needs to be updated to reflect
the change.

This hook is currently limited to verifying the IMA policy signature,
but could be the basis for a more generalized hook.
