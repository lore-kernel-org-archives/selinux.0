The most common use case for union mounts is a livecd. In this case the 
livecd iso has a tmpfs rw mount above it for copyup. I don't know how 
useful having a smart xattr copyup mechanism is in that place as most of 
the labels will be whatever is assigned to the iso. Another usecase is 
snapshotting of a filesystem for rollback. In this case it is probably 
important to retain the existing label as the copyup is supposed to be 
to the same location. The last case which is similar to the snapshotting 
case but with a persistant upper branch would be to have an NFS mount 
and have local configuration changes stored locally. In that case as 
well I can see simple copy up as being ok to do since you're using it 
more as an overlay than a union mount.

Now the tricky case is when you have two filesystems with two different 
directories with the same name. You're going to merge those namespaces. 
The problem occurs when the parent directories have different labels.

For example /mnt/upper/foo is labeled foo_t and /mnt/lower/foo is 
labeled foo2_t. What do you use for the label for files created in 
/mnt/union/foo?

I would assume its under their documentation patch. I tried to lookup 
up what we did for our copyup semantics for file attributes. Its not 
simple or straight forward in the original UnionFS. I think its safe to 
say all the first class attributes need to be copied up. When possible 
we also copied the xattrs as well. Its important to realize though that 
union mounts are namespace unification and not fileunification so if you 
copy one xattr up you need to copy them all because any that don't get 
copied will get left behind.
