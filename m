Smack is going to have some difficulties implementing CALIPSO due to
some previous design decisions and inconsistencies between how Smack
handles both IPv4 and IPv6 packet labeling today.  I think we can all
agree that asking Huw to resolve these problems isn't quite fair,
although asking Huw to make sure he doesn't break existing
functionality *is* fair, and a requirement for patch acceptance.

Huw, I would suggest you ensure that the NetLabel/CALIPSO changes
don't break the existing Smack code, and that everything is commented
appropriately.  Adding CALIPSO support to the netlbl_cfg_*() functions
in netlabel_kapi.c would also be a good idea, and shouldn't be too
difficult (I should have commented on this earlier, my mistake).
However, I think resolving the Smack IPv6 design issues is something
best left to Casey and the rest of the Smack developers.

Agreed, thanks Huw for all the hard work you put into this
implementation.  I started a similar effort on two separate occasions
but never had the time to see it through to the end; I'm happy that
someone was finally able to get it finished.
