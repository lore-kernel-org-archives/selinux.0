I have argued that in the past. I'm reasonably convinced that I have
lost that argument at least for the immediate future as audit, usb,
and networking are all dependent on them. I can't image an LSM that
manages to avoid them, at least for the short term. If secid's are
ever expundged from the kernel cachefiles will require reeducation,
but that will be a minor effort.

It would seem to me that security_secctx_to_secid() ought to suffice
if the application code was written correctly. Be aware that factors
outside the LSM may be important, too. As Stephen points out elsewhere,
Smack will require you have particular capabilities (CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE,
CAP_MAC_ADMIN) while a DAC LSM may require CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE. SELinux
is likely to be the odd duck in this pond in that it does not use the
capability mechanism in the way Nature intends it to be, opting to
treat "privilege" with a completely different model.
