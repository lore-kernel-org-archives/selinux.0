That's fine - see the discussion Venkat and I had earlier.  I'll change
it to jump to "out".

I was just trying to match what Venkat had already done.

It's easy enough to distinguish when there is not a NetLabel present and
skip the second check, but I think we need a second access check for
NetLabel when it is present as to skip that check could result in some
wierd behaviors if both forms of external labeling are used.

Yes, we all agree it's redundant to use both at the same time, but I
don't think there is anything preventing users from doing so at the
present time.

Easy enough to change.

I don't, that was a mistake/typo that I missed.  Thanks.
