I'm not going to NAK it, because I don't know it won't work,
but I'm not going to ACK it either, because I have not been
able to get it to work. I have no idea what the problem
might be, and the "obvious" things we've tried have proven
ineffective. I may have a bad set of user space tools. There
may be more work on Smack hooks required. I can't tell, and
there's way too much NFS set-up involved to make progress in
the limited time I have available.

If you're waiting for my ACK, no, you don't have it.
If you're OK with a lack of NAK, go ahead. There will
be changes someday I suspect, but I can't put this high
enough on my priorities to devote the time required
just now.
