True.  I'm not sure what's the best way to deal with that.  Possibly add an
extra flag to vfs_setxattr() and have the fs vet them...  OTOH, this gives us
files on the lowerfs that may well differ in appearance to files on the
upperfs with respect to their xattrs.

Also true.  It's possible that the best way is just to ignore everything but a
medium-related error such as EIO, ENOSPC and EDQUOT: We tried...  Oh well.

Yeah.  Ideally, the copied-up file would be indistinguishable from the lower
file, but in practice that's not possible unless inode numbers and other
physical characteristics of the lower file are recorded in the upper fs (say
on an xattr).

I would suggest 'cpyup' or 'copyup' rather than 'cpup' - the latter looks like
something to do with CPUs, but yes, it's worth considering.

That's not necessarily good enough.  What if and LSM, say SELinux, is in
force?  Now SELinux will happily label the files for you - but there's a
reasonable chance they won't be correct.  OTOH, they may not be correct even
if they are copied up.

Ummm...  Interesting question.  If it copies up a file, then that file must
have been opened for writing.  Is the mtime altered by such an event, or only
by a write() having been issued?  Also, what about ctime?  That doesn't seem
to have been copied up either.
