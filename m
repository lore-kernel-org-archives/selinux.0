If I was not clear I was suggesting that we allow a sufficiently
privileged user in the filesysteme's s_user_ns to allow chowning files
with INVALID_UID and INVALID_GID.

The global root user would always be able to do that because unless
capabilities are dropped it is sufficiently privileged in ever user
namespace.
