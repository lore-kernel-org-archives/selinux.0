Obviously there is a need to break CAP_SYS_ADMIN in pieces, to do so, you have to start somewhere, so I chose to begin with this.

If you look at the udiskd deamon used by most desktop environments, it is launched as root or at least with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. Here, you could use CAP_SYS_MOUNT. There might also be a use within containers as you don't want to give CAP_SYS_ADMIN to a container if it just need to mount/unmount filesystems. If you go even further, it could be used to allow swapon/swapoff (maybe in future patch set).
