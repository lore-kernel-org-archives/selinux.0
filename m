Ralf is at least the second person I've seen who had this problem since
the security tree merge.  The problem was not introduced in this merge,
it's just this merge was the first time I added new things to that file,
so it's the first time anyone would have noticed.  Introduced in
8753f6bec352392 but not really a problem until b782e0a68d17894d9a.

It's easily worked around deleting all of of the automagically generated
av_permissions.h files and letting them be regenerated but hardly anyone
would realize they need to delete files by hand (make clean, git clean,
etc won't delete it)

I think James is traveling for a bit so I'm putting it out there for a
faster track to inclusion.
