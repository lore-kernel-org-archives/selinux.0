Do you mean '__packed' or just structures with no holes?
The latter is really the best.
You can add a compile time assert on the structure sizes to ensure
that the user API is never accidentally broken.

I can't imagine any reason to change the 64bit structures except
(maybe) to make any padding explicit.

...

Isn't that effectively the same as doing a compat layer?
Otherwise you can't build a 32bit app that will work with an 'old'
32bit kernel and a new 64bit one.

Provided you've got the length of the user's buffer the compat code
ought to be trivial (if tedious).
