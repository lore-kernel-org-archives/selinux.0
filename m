Yes, I can cleanly break the fs/nfs/internal.h and fs/nfs/super.c
changes into a seperate patch.  It doesn't really help reviewability
though since they are already clearly segregated.  Originally I was
keeping around the legacy support for git biscect reasons but the switch
to nfs_parsed_mount_data already broke everything so there wouldn't be a
lose to separating them.  I'll send as 2 patches in a moment.

Let me explain the 2 mount paths and all the logic going on in here for
the case of NFS.  It is the only interesting FS.

The two call paths to get here both come through vfs_kern_mount()

vfs_kern_mount()
  get_sb()
    nfs_get_sb()
      security_sb_set_mnt_opts()

vfs_kern_mount()
  security_sb_kern_mount()
    superblock_doinit()
      security_sb_set_mnt_opts()

Now in this function we do multiple things (even through the name only
implies one thing.)  1) We set the security options on the superblock
security structure and 2) we make sure that these options don't conflict
with options previously used.

The idea is that some someone might do

mount -o context=context1 /dev/whatever /mnt/whatever1
mount -o context=context2 /dev/whatever /mnt/whatever2

This is going to use the same superblock but the context= needs to the
same.  There is no was to reconcile the 2, so we just reject the second
mount.

Binary FS's like NFS which call into the explicit set function will
still traverse the generic call path.  But on the generic call patch
vfs_kern_mount() is going to pass in null mount data and
superblock_doinit is going to turn that into an empty structure with
num_opts=0.  We don't want the mount to fail here because the mount
options set explicitly a moment ago aren't the same now.  Solutions
meant I either needed to be able to tell that it was the same mount
operation we saw on this code path both time or to just let it through
the second time.  I decided to just allow it through.

The drawback of the approach I took is that someone who does

mount -o context=context1 server1:/export/ /mnt/whatever1
mount                     server1:/export/ /mnt/whatever2

is NOT going to get a failure on the second mount.  It will still mount
just fine and it is going to share the mount options with the first
mount, just the user is not going to be informed that the security
options given were not the same on both.

Too much info?  was I just babbling?  did it make sense?  Let me know if
you still have any questions or problems with the possible outcomes...
