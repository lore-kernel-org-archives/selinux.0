I am going to have to look at this very carefully for the
Smack implications. I cannot have a review done for several
days. I do have some immediate comments below.

What does this mean? Is the "lower layer" the "real" file, or something else?
What is a "docker source"? What "single label" are you talking about, and
where does it come from? What about LSMs that have multiple labels on a file?

No. Sorry, but this is the one notion that doesn't work. A layer should
either be label transparent or restricted by some sort of range concept.
Giving it a label just makes it necessary to grant everyone access to objects
with that label.

Could you explain your terminology? I have no idea what the "overlay label"
might be. Is it the real one on the real filesystem? What about attributes
other than the access label? Smack has execution labels and a transmute
attribute as well as the access label.

Are you assuming a single overlay layer?

The Smack code, too.

Oh, and I have been lead to believe that upcoming AppArmor enhancements
could be affected as well.
