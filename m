The problem that Paul describes stems from the requirement of such trust
needing post-boot / install / setup keys.  It may be possible for an
environment to exist where there's a food chain that enables some CA's to
easily hand out keys to each install, but that seems impractical. This is why
Paul had mentioned the Machine Owner Key (MOK) thing.

Nitpick: its the system_verify_data() API, the fw signing stuff will make use
of this API as well.

Nitpick: to verify the data.

Sure that would work. Its how the module stuff can work in permissive mode.
We'd embrace the same practice for permissive fw signing as well.
