For the case of devices, its already happening. One might change metadata
of a device (hence trigger copy up). Now all writes to upper device file
from secret process still go to same underlying device and are still
readable from lower device file.

In fact, for the case of devices, that is even more of a reason to retain
the label same as lower. Otherwise upper device node is leaking data
of a secret process which can be accessed using device at lower/ (lower's
label is readable).

If we retain the label and if lower is not writable, then upper deivce
node is not being written to as well. So from label point of view, lower
and upper inode are not different. Only difference is that some metadata
of upper inode might be different.
