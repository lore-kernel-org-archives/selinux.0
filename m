This might be related to a problem that syzbot is failing to reproduce a problem.

  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/syzkaller-bugs/R03vI7RCVco/0PijCTrcCgAJ

  syzbot found a reproducer, and the reproducer was working until next-20180803.
  But the reproducer is failing to reproduce this problem in next-20180806 despite
  there is no mm related change between next-20180803 and next-20180806.

  Therefore, I suspect that the reproducer is no longer working as intended. And
  there was parser change (David Howells' patch) between next-20180803 and next-20180806.

I'm waiting for response from David Howells...
