I seem to be having some trouble presenting my point. It's not about
the passwords. It's not about the firewall configuration. It's not
even really about the SELinux policy. It's about the total security
configuration of the system. This is a problem with checkpoint/restart
in general and there isn't much we can do about reassigning user id
and other bad things that can happen.

If the admin decides that an action is acceptable because the SELinux
policy prevents some other action it had better be the case that a
process was never allowed to perform that "other action". If you allow
restart across policy changes you can't be sure that the process has
not performed such an "other action". Processes are not stateless.

That's the point. It does not have to do the bad thing, it has
already been done. The cat is out of the bag. The process now has
state that it couldn't get under the new policy. The new policy
allows the process to do something that it could not had it
started under the new policy.

I'm a firm believer in malicious users. That, and users who are
sufficiently stupid to be indistinguishable from malicious users.
That, and users who are sufficiently clever to do the same things
that a malicious user would do in order to do something that looks
like a really good idea, but that is not.
