Subject: [PATCH v3 00/21] Support fuse mounts in user namespaces

Hi Eric,

Sorry that it's taken a while to get this update sent out. In part
that's because of a few problems I found, which resulted in some new
patches.

I wanted to point out one problem in particular because I'm not fully
settled on the solution. It turns out that for the sysfs and cgroup
filesystems we already have use cases where a super block is mounted
from multiple user namespaces. With sysfs this is done when criu is used
to snapshot a container; it will mount sysfs in the container's network
namespace but the host's user namespace. cgroup fs uses the same super
block for all mounts of a given hierarchy, and the addition of cgroup
namespaces makes this possible from within non-init user namepsaces. So
the check in sget_userns() which forbids mounting an existing super
block in a different user namespace causes regressions, and really it's
not necessary for these filesystems since ids in the inodes aren't
subect to translation relative to s_user_ns.

I've tried several ways to fix this. The one I'm sending here is to
exempt these filesystems from this requirement, which is the simplest
solution. The down side is that I couldn't find any existing property of
these file systems to use for excluding them, so I'm using a new file
system flag. My second-best option was to change kernfs_test_super() to
return false if the existing super block is in a different user
namespace. This is also pretty simple and works fine for sysfs, but
cgroups require some updating in order to get its internal reference
counting to work out.

These patches are based on the for-testing branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace.git
with everything rebased onto 4.6-rc4. I've also pushed everything to:

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sforshee/linux.git fuse-userns

Changes since v2:

 - Add patch from Pavel Tikhomirov to fix a potential memory leak in
   sget_userns().
 - Add a patch to fix a bug in the fs_fully_visible() MNT_LOCK_NODEV
   handling which was introduced by "userns: Simpilify MNT_NODEV
   handling."
 - Drop patch to make root in s_user_ns capable towards that superblock
   and replace it with a patch to allow root in s_user_ns to change
   ownership of inodes with invalid ids.
 - Use make_k[ug]id() in fuse_fillattr() instead of copying ids from
   inode.
 - Remove unnecessary initialization of user_id and group_id in fuse
   mount options.
 - Add a comment to get_file_caps() to indicate that the duplicate
   in_userns() check is intentional.
 - Fix incorrect statements in commit message of "fuse: Add support for
   pid namespaces"
 - Added acks.

Thanks,
Seth
