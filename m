NAK.  Mapping all sysctls to a single security label prevents any kind
of fine-grained security on sysctls, and current policies already make
use of the current distinctions to limit access to particular sets of
sysctls to particular processes.  As is, I'd expect breakage of current
systems running SELinux from this patch, because (confined) processes
that formerly only required access to specific sysctl labels will
suddenly run into denials on the generic fallback label.

If the ctl_table supplied more information about the functional purpose
and the security sensitivity of the sysctl, then we could leverage that
information instead, as long as we can at least derive the current
labelings from that information for compatibility.
