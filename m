Great.

This seems to apply for some distributions.

Right so there are different solutions to this problem, it will depend on the
distribution and solution they have in place for this. For instance maybe some
distros may be satisfied with the integrity of the initramfs for kexec *iff*
they can vet for the integrity of the components that build the initramfs on
the target system, or perhaps they distribute the initramfs used by some
systems so they use singing facilities trusted by the kernel, or in the IMA
case you do boot up vetting through xatrrs and IMA.

A lot of this means a lot of these signing facilities then should be optional
and work in a permissive mode. Part of my earlier work (already merged) on the firmware
signing stuff was to take out from module signing code the part that let it be
permissive with my goal to re-share the same strategy for other purposes. This
is accomplished by using the bool_enable_only module parameter, for instance fw
signing will use:

+static bool sysdata_sig_enforce = IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SYSTEM_DATA_SIG_FORCE);
+#ifndef CONFIG_SYSTEM_DATA_SIG_FORCE
+module_param(sysdata_sig_enforce, bool_enable_only, 0644);
+#endif /* !CONFIG_SYSTEM_DATA_SIG_FORCE */

Technically it should also be possible to remove the #ifndef provided we can
all rest assured no bullets can be put through it. Anyway, that's the gist of
the permissive model copied from module signing. If we have a lot of similar
users it begs the question if we should somehow drivertize a generic interface
for these things so that the actual implemenation that deals with permissivity
is shared, its perhaps too early to do that now but something to keep in mind
as it does sound like we will have a bit of users of the same mechanisms /
strategy. Exactly how they need to be differentiated remains to be seen.

I see, thanks. Another way to do this is to copy the module signing
strategy and since the initramfs is linked in just peg the sinagure of the
blog at the end. This of course would mean you have to be permissive to
only enable folks who want this feature.

> > > eBPF/seccomp 

OK I knew nothing about this but I just looked into it, here are my notes:

  * old BPF - how far do we want to go? This goes so far as to parsing
    user passed void __user *arg data through ioctls which typically
    gets copy_from_user()'d and eventually gets BPF_PROG_RUN().

  * eBPF:
	                     seccomp() & prctl_set_seccomp()
					|
					V
	                     do_seccomp()
					|
					V
	                     seccomp_set_mode_filter()
					|
					V
	                     seccomp_prepare_user_filter()
					|
	                                V
	bpf_prog_create_from_user() (seccomp) \
	bpf_prog_create()                      > bpf_prepare_filter()
	sk_attach_filter()                    /

    All approaches come from user passed data, nothing fd based.

    For both old BPF and eBPF then:

    If we wanted to be paranoid I suppose the Machine Owner Key (MOK)
    Paul had mentioned up could be used to vet for passed filters, or
    a new interface to enable fd based filters. This really would limit
    the dynamic nature of these features though.

    eBPF / secccomp would not be the only place in the kernel that would have
    issues with user passed data, we have tons of places the same applies so
    implicating the old BPF / eBPF / seccomp approaches can easily implicate
    many other areas of the kernel, that's pretty huge but from the looks of
    it below you seem to enable that to be a possibility for us to consider.

I see thanks. In light of that its unclear why you'd want to "preserve"
the measurement list from one boot onto another.

Right so if such a solution were really desirable it would seem we'd be
wanting to change a histical approach to user <--> kernel interfaces.
This is a pretty significant change in paradigm. Is everyone on board?
