I don't care what Eric says, you're OK with me.

The behavior is interesting with a Smack kernel:

I create an export using the recommended options (sec=unix,security_label, ...)
of /pub. Then , I create a directory sub with the floor ("_") label and a file
named Pop labeled "Pop". I mount the filesystem at /mnt.

# ls -l /mnt
ls: cannot access /mnt/Pop: Permission Denied
total 4
?????????? ? ?    ?       ?            ? Pop
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Nov 20 17:57 sub

which is exactly correct!

Unfortunately, I get the exact same result if the process
is run with the Pop label. A process run with the Pop label
should be able to see the attributes of the file Pop.

It looks as if the basic mechanism is working, but that there
is some detail that is not working right. I will have to dig
deeper to understand what's up. Let me know if you have ideas.
