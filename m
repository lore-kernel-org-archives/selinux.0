netfilter hooks are per namespace -- so there is hook unregister when
netns is destroyed.

Do you think it makes sense to rework the patch to delay registering
of the netfiler hooks until the system is in a state where they're
needed, without the 'unregister' aspect?

Ideally this would even be per netns -- in perfect world we would
be able to make it so that a new netns are created with an empty
hook list.

Thanks.
