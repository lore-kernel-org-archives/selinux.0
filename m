I still don't undetstand how, from a security perspective,
sctp_socket:bindx is different from sctp_socket:bind.  I understand
the distinction is important from a SCTP perspective, but from a
SELinux perspective isn't sctp_socket:bindx simply sctp_socket:bind?
How is bindx different from bind?

The same applies for connect/connectx.

Okay, I think I'm getting a better idea of this ... let me walk
through some of this, slowly.

On the send/egress side of things we don't really need to worry about
the remote peer label as we only do access control checks using the
sender's label (the local process/socket).  There is a slight
exception with respect to forwarded traffic, but I think we handle
that correctly for SCTP by substituting the traffic's label for the
local process/socket label (current behavior).

On the receive/ingress side we could receive traffic from any of the
associations, with the peer:recv permission checking the remote peer
label (aka the sending association's label) against the local
receiving socket.  This seems right to me.  As far as userspace is
concerned, *_getpeersec_dgram() should work correctly, but
*_getpeersec_stream() will only return the peer label we stored during
the initial association setup, yes?  This seems ... not the best.
Although I'm not sure how to solve this.

Is this why the requirement exists for each association to have an
equivalent label?
