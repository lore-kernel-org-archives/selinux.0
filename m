Hi Casey and John

my patch set does not modify this behavior:  VFS calls on upper inodes
made by user processes and VFS calls (read/write) made by eCryptfs
on lower inodes still use the user's credentials.

In addition, SELinux provide a model for file descriptors. They may be
opened by another subject (which provided its own credentials) and
other processes need the 'use' permission for those file descriptors
other than permissions for related inodes.

This means that, even if eCryptfs opens lower inodes with its own
credentials, user processes still need permissions to read/write both
upper and lower inodes.

One benefit of allowing eCryptfs to provide its own credentials is that
user processes must have granted only strictly required permissions.
