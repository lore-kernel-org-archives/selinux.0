That might work. Any use of bpf() requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN but netd
could potentially just apply the prog_fd to a socket:

           setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_BPF,
                      &prog_fd, sizeof(prog_fd));

"use" might be sufficient. At least initially.

I could see some others coming in handy. For example, a simple mapping
of functionality to permissions gives:
map_create, map_update, map_delete, map_read, prog_load, prog_use.

Of course there's no sense in breaking "use" into multiple permissions if
we expect the entire set to always be granted together.
