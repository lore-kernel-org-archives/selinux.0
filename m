Huw is correct.  I haven't yet gone through this latest patchset,
although I've reviewed the previous versions and provided feedback;
the v3 revision looked pretty good to me and I'm assuming I won't find
any showstoppers in the v4 revision.

I'm happy to push this upstream via the SELinux tree, but only with an
implicit ACK from DaveM since it does touch of the core stack (in ways
comparable to what we did for CIPSO and IPv4).  If DaveM would prefer
to merge these patches via the netdev tree, that's fine too, I'll take
a closer look later this week and send my ACKs.

DaveM, let me know how you want to proceed with this patchset.
