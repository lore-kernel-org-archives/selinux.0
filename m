I would argue that if somebody wants to stick a base64-encoded image
or an x509 certificate in their security labels then shipping the
whole thing across the wire every time somebody does an extended
"stat" is just stupid.  Think about how much overhead there would be
if you did an "ls -Z" of a directory with 100 files (64k * 100 ==
6.4MB!!!), where that data would previously have fit in no more than
10-20k TOTAL.

A better solution would be something along the lines of putting at
most a SHA512 sum in the label field and have a separate caching
communication protocol (either in-band or out-of-band) to pass the
fully-descriptive payload.

Even in local filesystems like ext3 we prefer to turn labels into
numbers, store the number with each inode, and then keep the labels
indexed in a separate datastructure.

Cheers,
