I'm going to start with this last question and work my way backwards.

Who determines access rights to the block devices varies to some degree.
Any normal user could unshare the user/mount namespaces and still see
all the block devices in /dev. If we're going to allow that user to then
mount block devices in their private namespaces, the kernel must verify
that the user has appropriate permissions for the block device inode.
That's the point of this patch. In a container context the host process
which sets up the container might share some block devices into the
container via bind mounts, in which case it would be responsible for
setting up access rights (both via inode permissions and potentially via
devcgroups). I also have some patches I'm working on for a loop psuedo
filesystem which would allow a container to allocate loop devices for
its own use (via the loop-control device), in which case the kernel
creates a device node in the loopfs filesystem from which the new loop
device was allocated, owned by the root user in the user namespace
associated with the loopfs superblock.

Obviously a DM block device is more complicated than a traditional block
device. This patch should ensure that if an unprivileged user tries to
mount a DM blkdev that it fails if the user lacks permissions for the DM
blkdev inode. There's also the blkdevs behind the DM blkdev, and I'm not
sure whether we need to additionally verify that the user has access to
those devices. Maybe it's enough that someone with access to them set up
the DM device, and someone with sufficient privileges gave that user
access to the DM device. Do you have any thoughts?

As for activating a DM device, I assume only root is permitted to do
this. In that case lookup_bdev will skip the inode permission check
even if a non-zero permission mask is passed.

That's great, I really appreciate it.
