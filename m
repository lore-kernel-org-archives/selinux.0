Ok.  Each "hook" would require a separate config option to allow
flexibility.  With this design, the decision for requiring signatures
would be made at build.  Do we really want policy hard coded into the
kernel?   (IMA is policy based.)

At the same time the boot loader verifies the kernel signature, it could
verify the the initramfs signature.  kexec should emulate whatever the
boot loader's method for verifying the initramfs signature.

The TPM is reset on a hard reboot, not a soft one like kexec.  Without
preserving the measurement list across kexec, we would not be able to
validate the quote.

Perhaps defining a common method and converting an example or two would
make sense,  before making sure "everyone" is on board.   The IMA policy
could be the first. Dmitry has already added support for verifying the
policy's signature for those systems without an initramfs.  I can look
into generalizing that solution.
