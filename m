If I'm not mistaken whats happening here is that some old 16 bit windows libraries have static addresses rather than pc offset or dynamically calculated ones. I don't think linux apps have ever done this so...

Beyond wine no other applications should use this.

The best solution would be to add code to wine which performs address recalculations either or the fly or at load time. Alternatively you could tell people who want 16 bit support to run wine or windows in a VM.
Or a boolean could be added to allow wine to support 16 bit applications which would allow it to do this, basically the same idea you had but in a way past selinux users might understand better then needing to set a system value. Make the default value off and tell users, you set this and your kernel may be compromised, try with it off first, run it in a VM and only if you absolutely have to should you allow this.
