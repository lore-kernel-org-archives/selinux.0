Yes, that would be possible. Unfortunately, many distros ship
kernels with multiple security modules compiled in, but only one
in use. That would make the common case the worst case. For the
near (1-2 years) future the common case will be one security
module using blobs in use with multiple modules compiled.

The LSM infrastructure was built on the assumption that
most systems would not use additional security modules.
That was true then. It isn't now.
