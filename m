If one were attempting to use a context pertaining to the unlabeled init
sid in the SPD and/or the SAD. But would I be correct in assuming that the
same sid (unlabeled init sid in all likelyhood) would end up being returned
when the context is turned into a sid, resulting in the SPD and the SAD
using
the same init sid, thus making a full-context compare unnecessary?

The best I can think of is if the SA's sid doesn't match the
socket's SID, IKE would come into play, if it's configured.

I also wanted to conversely ask what harm exists if we did
a full-context compare in the event the sids didn't match?

Are we just trying to generally avoid extra code?
