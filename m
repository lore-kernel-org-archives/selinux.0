I am wary of situations where the handling of access rights implicity
implies other access rights.  We have discussed such schemes in the
past (e.g. we considered a design for RESOLVE_UNIX where we'd have
both a "scoped" and a "access_fs" right that would interact with each
other), but in the end we always settled for approaches where such
interactions would not be necessary.  One of the concerns was that it
would complicate "best effort" fallback logic in all Landlock
libraries and in the countless places where people use the syscalls
directly.

To throw another option in the mix.  (To be clear, I have only 70%
confidence, so feel free to push back, but it feels like it might
work?):

Is this similar to the "truncate" right?
----------------------------------------

With "truncate", there was an existing common operation (open(2) with
O_TRUNC, a.k.a. creat(2)) which called the truncation hook and checked
for the truncation access right.  But that was in fact OK.  The way we
resolved it at the time was by documenting very loudly that WRITE_FILE
and TRUNCATE access rights should always be requested in lockstep, if
TRUNCATE is handled.

If READ_DIR and READ_FILE do in fact read and return metadata to the
user, maybe the right thing would be to do it the same way here and
*require* that we have READ_METADATA to do these operations?

(READ_METADATA is automatically allowed as long as it's not handled,
so that approach does not break existing programs.  Programs who
consciously start handling READ_METADATA must simply take into account
that reading directories and opening files for reading requires
READ_METADATA.)

(BTW, I can see it for reading directories, but I am not sure I fully
follow the argument why opening files for reading means that you can
read the metadata?  Can't that be guarded on fstat()-like operations?)
