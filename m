That's up to the cache.  CacheFS, for example, unpins some resources when all
the pages managed by a pointer block are taken away from it.  The cache may
also reserve a block on disk to back this page, and that reservation may then
be discarded by the netfs uncaching the page.

The cache may also speculatively take copies of the page if the machine is
idle.

Documentation/filesystems/caching/netfs-api.txt describes the caching API as a
process, including the presentation of netfs pages to the cache and their
uncaching.

[Documentation/filesystems/caching/netfs-api.txt]
==============
PAGE UNCACHING
==============

To uncache a page, this function should be called:

	void fscache_uncache_page(struct fscache_cookie *cookie,
				  struct page *page);

This function permits the cache to release any in-memory representation it
might be holding for this netfs page.  This function must be called once for
each page on which the read or write page functions above have been called to
make sure the cache's in-memory tracking information gets torn down.

Note that pages can't be explicitly deleted from the data file.  The whole
data file must be retired (see the relinquish cookie function below).

Furthermore, note that this does not cancel the asynchronous read or write
operation started by the read/alloc and write functions.

[Documentation/filesystems/caching/fscache.txt]
 (7) Data I/O is done direct to and from the netfs's pages.  The netfs
     indicates that page A is at index B of the data-file represented by cookie
     C, and that it should be read or written.  The cache backend may or may
     not start I/O on that page, but if it does, a netfs callback will be
     invoked to indicate completion.  The I/O may be either synchronous or
     asynchronous.
[/]

I should perhaps make the documentation more explicit: the pages passed to the
routines defined in include/linux/fscache.h are netfs pages, normally belonging
the pagecache of the appropriate netfs inode.  This is, however, mentioned in
the function banner comments in fscache.h.

It is a requirement laid down by the Linux NFS fs maintainers that the writes
to the cache be asynchronous, even if the writes to NFS aren't.

Note further that NFS's write_page() != writing to the cache.  Writing to the
cache is typically done by NFS's readpages().

Besides, at the moment, caching is suppressed for any NFS file opened for
writing due to coherency issues.  This is something to be revisited later.

Not as now.  See above.

You can't necessarily access the BIO interface, and even if you can, the cache
is still a filesystem.

Essentially, what cachefiles does is to do what you say: to perform ->write
calls on another filesystem.

FS-Cache also protects the netfs against (a) there being no cache, (b) the
cache suffering a fatal I/O error and (c) the cache being removed; and protects
the cache against (d) the netfs uncaching pages that the cache is using and (e)
conflicting operations from the netfs, some of which may be queued for
asynchronous processing.

FS-Cache also groups asynchronous netfs store requests together, which
hopefully, one day, I'll be able to pass on to the backing fs.

NFS and AFS and CIFS and ISOFS, but yes, that's what fscache is, if you like, a
caching library.

The netfs should _not_ know about the metadata of a backing fs.  Firstly, there
are many different potential backing filesystems, and secondly if the netfs
knows about the metadata of the backing fs, then the backing fs has to ask the
netfs's permission if it wants to change it (background defragmentation, for
instance).

The only bit of metadata Cachefiles asks for is whether a block is represented
on disk or not.  This indicates whether the page held in that block is in the
cache or whether it has to be retrieved from the server.  The answer to that
shouldn't change if the backing fs shuffles its (meta)data around on disk.

It's an indication to the netfs that the cache has an interest in this page,
where an interest may be a pointer to it, resources allocated or reserverd for
it, or I/O in progress upon it.

And a waste of my time.  I've provided documentation in the main FS-Cache
patch, both as text files and in comments in header files that answer your
questions.  Please read them first.

Actually, it is ideally:

    1) NFS client page cache.

But, because I can't do in-kernel O_DIRECT at the moment, with _CacheFiles_, it
is:

    1) NFS client page cache.
    2) Backing fs page cache.

With CacheFS it really is:

    1) NFS client page cache.

and it really does BIOs directly to/from the pages in the netfs.
