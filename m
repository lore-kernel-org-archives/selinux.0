But in cap_inode_setxattr, any security.* xattrs are controlled by
CAP_SYS_ADMIN.  So do you think that this should be changed to a
CAP_XATTR_SECURITY capability which can be added to CAP_FS_MASK?

Or do you think it's ok that fsuid=0 does not allow you to set
security.selinux (or security.SMACK64, etc) xattrs when selinux is
not compiled in?

(You may have already answered this with your EOPNOTSUPP comment, but
I want to make sure I understand right)

Well, if attr(5) says CAP_SYS_ADMIN being needed is the very
thing that defines these xattrs, then changing that seems a
bigger deal.  That really does seem akin to changing kernel-user
API.
