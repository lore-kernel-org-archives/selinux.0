I think the answer to this is not very easy at all. If the reason for
having something like this is to use it as a starting point for very
tiny policies I'm not sure how useful it is. For example lets say you
have an application that uses tmp files and they want to have them
labeled in a way that isolates them from base_t. You now need to
label /tmp so you can have your transition rule on your process type and
tmp_t. This means you now need to grant a bunch of permissions on temp_t
for base_t just to maintain the idea that base_t is completely
unconstrained.

This may seem good enough for some people which is why I resurrected
Serge's patch. I think the better idea would be to look at the way
reference policy is structured and see if it is organized properly. It
might be useful for us to be able to say here is an absolute minimum
policy for things we think are key to a Linux system and allow people to
build their application policies on top of that. This would give the
embedded people a much smaller initial footprint for what they need and
reference or fedora policy can be a set of modules on top of this base.
I know we already have this in the form of the base.pp module and a
bunch of other modules on top of it but I don't see how base.pp is
usable without a whole slew of modules.
