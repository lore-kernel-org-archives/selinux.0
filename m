Thanks for chasing this down while I was on vacation :)

If you look at how we handle outgoing labeled IPsec traffic, e.g.
selinux_xfrm_skb_sid_egress(), you'll see that we only check the first
xfrm because I don't believe it is ever possible for us to create a
xfrm bundle with mis-matching SELinux labels.

Inbound traffic is another story, we need to check the entire bundle.

I would probably make the LSM call the last check, as you've done; but
I have to say that is just so it is consistent with the "LSM last"
philosophy and not because of any performance related argument.

Speaking purely from a SELinux perspective, I'm not sure it matters:
as long as the labels match we are happy.  However, from a general
IPsec perspective it does seem like a reasonable thing.

Granted I'm probably missing something, but it seems a little odd that
the code isn't already checking that the selectors match (... what am
I missing?).  It does check the policies, maybe that is enough in the
normal IPsec case?
