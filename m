The NFSv4 working group has finally accepted Labeled NFS as part of the NFSv4.2
specification and it has been decided that a reposting of the Labeled NFS code
for inclusion into mainline was a good idea. The patches have been rebased onto
v3.7-rc2 and have been tested against the SELinux testsuite with the only
failures being for features not supported by NFS.
