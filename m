Or I could just give you this link and you should be good to go ;)

http://www.selinuxproject.org/~dpquigl/nfs-utils-rpms/

I haven't tried it but it should work. If it doesn't let me know and 
i'll try to fix it on my end. I'd imagine you might need to yum remove 
nfs-utils first before adding this new one or you could also try an rpm 
with the upgrade flag for this instead. Good luck.
