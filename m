I'm playing with lklfuse now, it's surprisingly easy to get up and
running. I did have a few problems though that I thought you'd like to
know about.

Unfortunately I still can't run it in background mode, I get a segfault.

It's working fine on light workloads, but I'm having issues when I start
trying to stress it. In a couple runs of the stress-ng filesystem
stressors I saw both stress-ng and lklfuse get stuck in uninterruptible
sleep during the first run, and during the second I got some OOM errors
in lklfuse followed by I/O errors and eventually a journal error that
cause the filesystem to go read-only.

The command I used for the first run was:

 stress-ng --class filesystem --all 0

And for the second:

 stress-ng --class filesystem --seq 0 -v -t 60

There really wasn't anything interesting in the lklfuse output for the
first run, but for the second run I pasted the output here:
http://paste.ubuntu.com/13346993/

I still need to compare this to other fuse filesystems since I haven't
tried this kind of stress test on any others.
