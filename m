A while back I posted a (ugly) patch trying to address a quirk found
dealing with NFS and it's use of binary mount data.

http://marc.info/?l=linux-nfs&m=117856053112297&w=2

The answer was LSM modules/SELinux 'stop trying to read NFS's binary
mount data.'  So now I'm working on a real long term solution to the
problem.

A two second overview of how this work now.  With binary mount data,
SELinux checks if the FS is NFS and if so inside try_context_mount() it
casts the data to a nfs_mount_data and then grabs the security context
from the data->context field added in version 6 of the nfs_mount_data.
Its being doing that for quite some time now.  For any FS which has
binary mount data other than NFS it is impossible to pass security
relevant information to the SELinux.  For text mount options selinux
walks the string, copies all of the relevant options (context=,
fscontext=, defcontext=, rootcontext=) to a new page and then inside
try_context_mount() uses those options.

Since everyone seemed to agree that having selinux grab the context out
of the binary data was the wrong way to do things it appears that
filesystems like NFS, which have binary mount data, are going to need a
way to pass the security information contained in that mount data
through the VFS to get it to the LSM hooks.  I figure we can add a new
vfs_kern_mount_secdata() which takes as a argument a string which
contains all of the relevant security information.  This string can then
be passed right on down into the security modules and we can eliminate
the NFS specific handling of the mount data in the selinux code.

The first problem with this right now is that the SELinux parser is
expecting to get full mount options like context=user_u:role_r:type_t
but the NFS code (somewhere I haven't figure out where yet) is
manipulating the security string and taking the context=blah and
stripping the first part of the string and only storing the part after
the =.  Which means that now something is going to have to change how
the security options are being handled.  I can see this being done a
couple of places

?the nfs code - can just store the full text string it got in userspace
and pass it along.  Other binary mount data FS's could do the same
thing.  (I think this is the best option)

?the nfs code - can just append context= onto the front of the string
before it calls into the new vfs_kern_mount_secdata() function, seems
like this is not the place to add some selinux specific text
manipulation, but then again, nfs decided to pull that part of the
string off, why can't it put it back?

?the vfs to a new LSM hook - create some new hook which verifys the data
and can manipulate it if needed before it is passed to the real LSM
hook?  (ok this is a terrible idea)

?extra flags being passed down to the original security_sb_kern_mount
hook - if we pass extra flags down the security_sb_kern_mount to say
this came from a binary mount then the selinux code could deal with all
of the special casing itself.

?no extra flags and selinux code can just assume what is meant when it
gets a string without one of the tokens it recognizes.  Right now we
catch those errors and bomb out, but I haven't ever seen the printk...

Personally I think the 'fix' should be to store the full string in the
data->context field of the nfs data instead of making the NFS chain
parse and manipulate the string.  If others in the NFS world agree to
this solution can you give me pointers to where the context= part of the
mount options got pulled off?   Is that in userspace?

It also is a bit of a change in meaning for the ->context field.  It no
longer would be just a selinux context and would instead be a 'security
string' which could contain all of the possible options someday and
would get parsed correctly.

I also heard that NFS was going to go to a text mount option in the
future and maybe for such a corner case of a problem (remember that link
way back at the top) we could just ignore all of this until that
happens.  If so I think all of the problem would go away since selinux
can just find its options from the text string like every other FS
already does.  In the meantime maybe people would be agreeable to a
nasty hack inside the SELinux code (something like changing the nfs
specific check in try_context_mount to (d->version <  NFS_MOUNT_VERSION)
&& (d->version < 0xc00000000) to get the same result as my previous hack
in the other patch but realize that d->version might actually be a
pointer to a kernel data structure rather than to a version field)

So what is the right longterm solution?  Add a new vfs function which
takes a security string and change NFS to keep the whole string?  Wait
the problem out and go with a hack?  Do something I haven't though of?

-Eric
