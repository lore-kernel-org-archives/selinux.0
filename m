In all the cases that call tun_attach() we have a new socket which needs to be 
labeled based on the tun->security label, yes?  That is what the 
security_tun_dev_attach() code does, there is no need for access control at 
this point as the operation has already been authorized by either 
security_tun_dev_create() (new device), security_tun_dev_create_queue() (new 
queue), or security_tun_dev_open() (opening persistent device).

I think we are all set, or am I missing something?
