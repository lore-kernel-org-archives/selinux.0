Red Hat QE reported that chcon fails over NFSv4.2 on recent kernels.
The problem is related to how filesystems are mounted in NFSv4.

When an NFSv4 client performs a mount operation, it first mounts the
NFSv4 root and then does path walk to the exported path and performs a
submount on that, cloning the security mount options from the root's
superblock to the submount's superblock in the process.

Unless the NFS server has an explicit fsid=0 export with the
"security_label" option, the NFSv4 root superblock will not have
SBLABEL_MNT set, and neither will the submount superblock after cloning
the security mount options.  As a result, setxattr's of security labels
over NFSv4.2 will fail.

NFS servers with a modern nfs-utils package will automatically create a
pseudo fs to fill in the gaps (including the root itself) leading up to
the actual export, so it is uncommon these days for an NFS server to
have an explicit fsid=0 export.

Allowing the NFSv4 client to override the SECURITY_LSM_NATIVE_LABELS
flag on an initialized superblock would ensure that SBLABEL_MNT is set
when the client traverses from an exported path without the
"security_label" option to one with the "security_label" option.

Scott Mayhew (2):
  selinux: allow SECURITY_LSM_NATIVE_LABELS to be set on an already
    initialized superblock
  nfs: update labeling behavior on a superblock when submounting
