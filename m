There are a set of facilities that (currently, at least)
can't be shared by multiple LSMs for one reason or another.
XFRM and secmark have pretty well been declared as hopeless
for expansion due to the sk_buff "32 bits is all you're ever
going to get now shut up and go away" stance taken by certain
networking maintainers. NetLabel might possibly be made to
support multiple CIPSO tag types and while I don't think that
it makes sense to put much effort into doing so, if there is
a coin flip choice it should go in the direction of allowing
it. The presentation facility is there to address the "current"
interface in /proc, where backward compatibility is necessary.

Audit, on the other hand, uses secids but is capable of dealing
with multiple LSMs, provided it can identify which LSM goes
with which secid.

The most general case (audit) needs to keep a secid for each LSM.
This is easy enough to do. The networking facilities (XFRM,
secmark and NetLabel) always want to deal with exactly one,
although as I mentioned previously, NetLabel could conceivably
be multiple LSM aware someday. When audit and XFRM interact
there needs to be a way to identify which of the secids audit
is going to use is the one XFRM cares about.

There are two ways to do this. One is to identify the
security_operations structure associated with the LSM or to
identify the slot in the secids structure that holds that LSM's
secid. The security_operations structure contains the
information about the slot in the secids structure. The most
general way to identify the information about these special
cases is to identify the security_operations that go with them.


I hope that is helpful. I fear that I may not be getting
the core concept across. The idea is to make it easier to
deal with the special interfaces in the general cases.

I don't think it ever comes up, which would imply we don't need
netlbl_enabled(), either.

Using the NetLabel secid slot is necessary because when we get into
the auditing code the secid needs to be in the right place to associate
it with the right LSM.
