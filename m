Understood, I agree.

Achieving separation via SELinux is easily done, with libvirt/sVirt already 
doing this for us automatically in most cases; the only thing we will want to 
do is make sure the SELinux policy is aware of the new permission.

Achieving separation via DAC should also be easily done, simply run each QEMU 
instance with a separate UID and/or GID.

I'm quickly looked at tun_chr_open() again and I don't see any special 
rights/privileges required, the same for tun_chr_ioctl() and 
__tun_chr_ioctl().  Looking at tun_set_queue() I see we call tun_not_capable() 
which does a simple DAC check; it must have the same UID/GID or have 
CAP_NET_ADMIN.

I'm having a hard time seeing the problem you are describing; help me 
understand.

Once again, should be possible using either SELinux, DAC, or both.
