Yes, I think we do want to audit the security denial since it is the
reason we could not change the policy. In the flush case it seem it will
be the only reason. As you suggested, I will audit the first denial
since this is the reason the flush will fail.

But sometimes, in other cases, the delete or add could fail for other
reasons too such as not being able to allocate memory, not finding the
entry, etc... which is passed in the result field.
