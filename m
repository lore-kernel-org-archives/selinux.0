But that's exactly why it seemed like it ought to be in there.  If
SELinux is enabled, then SELinux will continue to perform it's own
checks based on security context and ignoring privileged root.  But
outside of that, since we are in a root-is-privileged mode, should it
not be the case that having fsuid=0 means that you can set extended
attributes in the security namespace?

Conversely, if setting fsuid to non-zero, shouldn't all of the
privileged ways of setting file attributes be lost?  Or, will we run
into a problem where software wanted to set its fsuid to non-0 but
still be able to call sethostname(2), for instance?  In which case
we simply cannot put CAP_SYS_ADMIN in CAP_FS_MASK.

I guess it comes back down to whether those xattrs are considered a
security attribute or a simple file property.
