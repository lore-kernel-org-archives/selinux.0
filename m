I agree that wrong policies could cause userspace to break, but that the
same for any kind of access control/restriction (e.g. your seccomp
example).

This series fill a gap which is to forbid access to metadata.  As for
other kind of access rights, this should be use wisely, and (user space)
libraries can help.

To be able to deny reading or modifying file's attributes, following the
Landlock model means to "handle" the related access rights, and
potentially to add exceptions to that with rules.

Your concern is legitimate and the documentation should warn about this
case (i.e. most of the time, users should tie READ_FILE with
READ_METADATA...).

That would make the kernel code more complex, especially wrt nested
domains.  However, user space libraries/configurations can make that the
default.  Anyway, if user space break with this kind of too strict
policy, I guess it would be quite loud and then fixed quickly.

Also, some tailored user space programs may not need to read metadata.
