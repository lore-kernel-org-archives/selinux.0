Fair question.  It was discussed a while back on either the SELinux or LSPP
mailing list, I don't have a link handy but I'm sure you could find it with your
favorite search engine (it was discussed back when it was a semaphore); I might
be wrong but I think it was Stephen Smalley that suggested using the isec
semaphore/mutex.  Basically, inode_security_struct mutex also protects the
sk_security_struct->nlbl_state field.  You will see some cases where the
nlbl_state field is set/checked without holding the mutex but in those cases
only one thread should have access to the sock.

Perhaps at some point it would make sense to protect this with some other
locking mechanism (rcu might make the most sense) but considering the stage that
2.6.19 is at right now I think we should probably leave it alone right now.
