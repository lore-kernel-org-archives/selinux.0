If the void pointer is wrapped by a #ifdef (plenty of precedence for that) and 
the management of that pointer is handled by LSM hooks why is it a concern?  I 
apologize for pushing on the issue, but I'm having a hard time reconciling the 
reason for the "no" with the comments/decisions about the regression fix; at 
present there seems to be a level of contradiction between the two.
