There's a one line change to the Smack code in 15/17 due to
a change in the api, but I assume that there has been no
attempt to verify that this works with Smack. It's not 100%
clear that this won't break a Smack kernel, but I haven't
tried it.

You'll need to provide sufficient information (or code!) so
that security modules other than SELinux can use this. If
you look at how Smack uses netlabel for IPv4 you will see
that it differs substantially from the way SELinux uses it.

Thank you for tackling RFC 5570. The lack of something like
this has put IPv6 at a real disadvantage.
