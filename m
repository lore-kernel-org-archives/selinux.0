Currently SELinux enforcement of controls on the ability to map the 0 page
is determined by the mmap_min_addr tunable.  This patch causes SELinux to
ignore the tunable and to always (but ONLY) protect the 0 page.

The tunable will now only control the need for CAP_SYS_RAWIO and SELinux
permissions will always protect the 0 page based on it's mmap_zero
permission.

This allows users who need to disable the mmap_min_addr controls (usual reason
being they run WINE as a non-root user) to do so and still have SELinux
controls preventing confined domains (like a web server) from being able to
map the 0 page.

Note: the additional SELinux restriction will now ONLY protect the 0 page.
CAP_SYS_RAWIO will protect anything between 0 and mmap_min_addr, but SELinux
will only protect between 0 and PAGE_SIZE.
