When the security scheme is better implemented in user space
because it requires information available in user space I agree.
When the security scheme is implemented in user space because
the environment for building it in the kernel is not up to
modern development paradigms I disagree. If you can't work on
two aspects of your security independently you're not going
to keep up with the Jones'.

Please review the arguments made in support of dropping the
LSM entirely in favor of SELinux as *the* Linux security
infrastructure.

I certainly agree that no one LSM covers all need today.
I also agree that no single LSM will ever meet everyone's
needs. My solution is to allow multiple LSMs so that it is
easier to approach the goal.

What I was hoping to say, and apparently didn't, is that people
are developing "total" solutions in user space, when some of the
work ought to be done in an LSM. Work that is appropriate to the
kernel is being done in user space. Often badly, because the
kernel provides too many mechanisms to circumvent user space
based access controls.

And we'll be arguing what "must" means long after penguins get the vote.

User space code does not have the opportunity to control the
objects that the kernel manages. Nor should it. Files, sockets,
network packets and signals all must be managed in the kernel.
Some of the user space attempts we're seeing are pretty scary.

Or SELinux and TOMOYO. Or AppArmor and TOMOYO.

And before we get too far, distros are no longer the driving force
for Linux development. I suggest that "operating systems", including
ChromiumOS, Android and Tizen are every bit as important. I suggest
that if Android wants to use SELinux and AppArmor those wild and
crazy folks in Mountain View ought to be able to do so.

> Yama is special-cased and can stay that way.

Yama is *not* a special case, it is an example. It is the kind
of new thing that provides security that is not access control.
It was special cased at the request of distros because there was
no general mechanism for including it along with the primary
LSM.

I'm not the advocate for that particular combination.
The point is that there are advocates. And distros are not
the only drivers. I agree that some consumer (distro, "OS")
needs to step forward.

Android utilizes UIDs in a way that has often been referred to as
"hijacking". The UID mechanism supports much of what they want,
but clearly isn't complete. Now that Android is moving to multi-user
support they're hitting conflicts with their use of the UID 
attribute. They really ought to be using an LSM that implements
the security policy they want rather than hacking around the
behavior of UID based controls.

That multiple LSMs provides the tool is not speculation.
That new development would ensue is indeed speculative.
Or at least not yet public.

Disto & OS vendors have the knowledge and tools to do this right.

Nope. I'm saying that for specific use cases including but not limited to
telephones, TVs and surveillance networks it is simpler and more appropriate
to create the access control and security schemes that directly address
the needs than to attempt to squeeze them into corsets designed in the
1990's.

And to top it off, Yama has no configuration. It's lots easier to configure.
