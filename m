As I already said above:

"While marking the LSM hook structure doesn't directly affect the
SELinux netfilter hooks, once we remove the ability to deregister the
LSM hooks we will have no need to support deregistering netfilter
hooks and I expect we will drop that functionality as well to help
decrease the risk of tampering."
