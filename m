Yep.  I was just trying to see if there was a way we could avoid having to 
make it conditional on CONFIG_SECURITY, but I think this is a better approach 
than the alternatives.

I'm also looking into making sure we get a sane LSM label on the per-cpu sock 
as security_sk_alloc() just allocates and initializes the LSM blob to a basic 
starting value (unlabeled_t in the case of SELinux) ... that is likely to be 
the tricky bit.

Regardless, I'm okay with us merging the patch below now to fix the panic and 
I'll supply a follow-up patch to fix the labeling once I figure out a solution 
that seems reasonable.  Does that work for you?  David?
