Have you run any benchmarks, particularly to compare performance 
overhead in the simple case of a single LSM?

IIRC, the AppArmor devs indicated that they plan to start using secids, 
which would mean that it would not be possible to stack AppArmor with 
Smack or SELinux using this mechanism.  So eventually that would have to 
be addressed in order for this to even support the AppArmor+Smack or 
AppArmor+SELinux use cases.
