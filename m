Right.

Ok, thanks for time.  It's all pretty clear to me now:

CAP_MKNOD and CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE need to be added to the CAP_FS_MASK
because, in 2.0 timeframe, fsuid==0 gave you those privileges.

xattrs didn't exist back then, so the setting of security.* and
trusted.* xattrs doesn't need to be enabled by fsuid==0.  So really
CAP_SETFCAP also doesn't need to be added to CAP_FS_MASK either.

I'll send out a patch later today for 2.6, unless Igor wants to
do it (since he's the one who found this originally).

thanks,
