Thanks for pointing out this. I agree we should only do checks on
creating and passing
the object from one processes to another. And if we can still
distinguish the read/write operation
when obtaining the file fd, that would be great. But that may require
us to add a new mode
field into bpf_map struct and change the attribute struct when doing
the bpf syscall. How do you
think about this approach? Or we can do simple checks for
bpf_obj_create and bpf_obj_use when
creating the object and passing the object respectively but this
solution cannot distinguish map modify and
read.
