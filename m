If you want that to be the case you need to make your case to Trond
about that. I've already had this conversation before and he seems to
think that a page is sufficient. Bruce also has concerns about not
wanting these labels to require a high order allocation. Under memory
pressure finding 16 contiguous pages for each label might be a problem.
