Hi Casey - I think what Roberto is getting at is the way eCryptfs uses
only one lower file per eCryptfs inode. Imagine that there are 5
files open for ~/secret/foo at the eCryptfs layer, only 1 file is going
to be open in the lower filesystem and all eCryptfs file operations will
be multiplexed through it.

To make things more complicated, if the eCryptfs file is opened for
writing, the lower file must be opened for reading and writing. This is
because a write operation requires eCryptfs to vfs_read() from the lower
filesystem, decrypt that data and then vfs_write() the new data.

If the lower file can't be opened O_RDWR by the calling process, the
request is handed off to a kernel thread to open the lower file on
behalf of the calling process. It is definitely ugly.

Roberto, I hope I correctly described the situation that you're trying
to address. Can you tell me why we can't have a 1:1 mapping of eCryptfs
files to lower files?

Instead of having just one lower file attached to the eCryptfs inode, we
could have a list of opened files. There would be one for each eCryptfs
file that was opened. ecryptfs_writepage() would have to pick, in a
somewhat random fashion, one of the lower files to use. Of course, we
would still need to solve the problem of opening the lower file O_RDWR
when the calling process is only allowed write access (I may have just
answered my own question of why the 1:1 mapping technique won't solve
this problem).
