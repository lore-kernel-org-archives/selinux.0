Checkpoint/restart has traditionally been interesting in the
mainframe and supercomputer space. These environments have very
different security profiles from a user desktop. No one at the
[.......] National Supercomputer Centre cares if you can save
your rogue game as soon as you pick up the Amulet of Yendor and
restart it if you get killed on the way up. These environments
are concerned with leaking data between the groups that have
funded the facility, which is why they are very often customers
of advanced access control technologies. I don't know that I see
a really good security story for C/R in the desktop space, and
as Russell points out, there are plenty of opportunities to
exploit the feature. This is of course well outside the scope of
what goes on within an LSM, where the specific issues are more
or less contained.
