Keeping in mind (R1a), I wonder if it makes more sense for (OTBND1a) to take 
the label of the process/domain which sends the data to the socket?  After 
all, the process/domain is the "origin" of the data.  This seems to be 
particularly important in the case of fork()-then-exec() where you could have 
a socket created at a different context from the domain currently writing to 
it.
