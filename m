Sorry - to clarify, I understand that we have to store a representation
of the security attribute in the backing data structure so that it can
be restored later, but that representation should come from the security
module rather than being the original (name, value, size) triple.  Which
is what David's patch does - he obtains a secid from the security module
for storage in the wrapped iattr structure.

And you don't need to apply any permission check here, as it gets
covered by the security_inode_setxattr() hook in vfs_setxattr() prior to
invoking i_op->setxattr.
