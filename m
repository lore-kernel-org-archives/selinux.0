Great, thanks for giving it a try and reporting the issues.

I got it to reproduce as well now. Not sure why how it worked before,
probably a race condition between lkl initialization and fuse calls.

I will reproduce it and take a look.

lklfuse allocates a fixed 100MB to the kernel and this is probably not
enough. For the short term I can add a parameter to lklfuse that
allows the user to specify the amount of memory to allocate to lkl. A
better fix would probably be to dynamically adjust the memory size of
lkl. I am thinking of using the ballon virtio driver or the memory
hotplug infrastructure. Any other suggestions?

I created a couple of issues in github [1] that you can track if you
want - I want to avoid spamming the list with reporting progress on
them.
