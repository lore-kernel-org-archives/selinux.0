Do you by any chance have EVM enabled?  EVM includes the i_mode in the
HMAC calculation.  Anytime the i_mode changes, the existing HMAC is
verified, before recalculating the HMAC to reflect the change.  The
hooks are there to update the HMAC, when using chmod.

I posted a couple of patches to audit this type of error last week, but
haven't sent a pull request yet.

evm: audit integrity metadata failures
integrity: move integrity_audit_msg()
evm: calculate HMAC after initializing posix acl

thanks,

Mimi
