Thank you for review!

I will link the feature request
(https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/11) in the v2 cover letter.

For https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/18, the current
READ_METADATA cannot solve this problem, and I don't have a good idea 
for now.

For path_* rename, I'd rather keep the inode_* names:

* There is precedent for the mismatch: the inode_getattr hook
   upstream already takes a "const struct path *" (this series just
   aligns the other metadata hooks with it).

* The path_* prefix has an established meaning in the LSM hook
   interface: it denotes the pathname-based (TOMOYO/AppArmor-style)
   hooks that are invoked at the VFS path level *before* the
   corresponding inode_* hook, as a paired, duplicate check
   serving a different class of LSMs.  For example, a chmod(2)
   currently runs security_path_chmod() (fs/open.c, for TOMOYO and
   AppArmor) and then, via notify_change(),
   security_inode_setattr() (for SELinux, Smack and now Landlock);
   vfs_mknod() similarly calls both security_path_mknod() and
   security_inode_mknod().  Renaming inode_setattr to
   path_setattr would put two path_-prefixed hooks with different
   call contracts into the same syscall, and path_chown(path,
   uid, gid) next to a path_setattr(path, attr) would read as a
   redundant pair, even though they belong to different hook
   families.  Landlock itself already uses the path_* family for
   its real path-level hooks (e.g. path_truncate for the TRUNCATE
   right), so mixing renamed inode hooks into that prefix would
   also blur its own hook table.

* If the consensus is that these hooks should be renamed, I think
   that should be a standalone, tree-wide rename series (including
   inode_getattr), so that BPF programs only break once instead of
   twice.
