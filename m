I see, thanks, ok so BPRM_CHECK = for binary loading, are you folks
really wanting to unify LSM hooks for firmware, modules, and binary
data ?

POST_SETATTR seems to be for inode_post_setxattr, so that as well?

POLICY_CHECK seems broad, not sure what to relate that to exactly.
Is this just SELinux polify files? Or is this something more broad?

That's correct, and no I was not thinking of a separate hook but rather
a type that lets the LSM know that MOK was used to sign the file consumed.
