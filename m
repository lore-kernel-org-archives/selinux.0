While I appreciate the patch and the work that went into development
and testing, I'm going to reject this patch on the grounds that it
conflicts with work we've just started thinking about which should
bring some tangible security benefit.

The recent addition of post-init read only memory opens up some
interesting possibilities for SELinux and LSMs in general, the thing
which we've just started looking at is marking the LSM hook structure
read only after init.  There are some complicating factors for
SELinux, but I'm confident those can be resolved, and from what I can
tell marking the hooks read only will have no effect on other LSMs.
While marking the LSM hook structure doesn't directly affect the
SELinux netfilter hooks, once we remove the ability to deregister the
LSM hooks we will have no need to support deregistering netfilter
hooks and I expect we will drop that functionality as well to help
decrease the risk of tampering.
