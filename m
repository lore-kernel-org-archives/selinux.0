I'm not talking about the peer_sid changes, although I'm glad they are
part of the secid patchset - thank you.  I'm talking about the patch I
keep reposting to include NetLabel is the secid reconciliation path.

There was a secid patchset posted on Thursday (9/28) night, I posted the
a patch on Friday (9/29) to provide NetLabel support.

There was a secid patchset posted on Sunday (10/1) night, I respun the
NetLabel support patch on Monday (10/2) - "v2".

I respun the NetLabel support patch to take into account Stephen
Smalley's comments on Monday (10/2) - "v3".

There was a small update to the secid patches yesterday (10/3) so I
respun the NetLabel support patch (10/4) - "v4".

Yes, the discussion is a good one I don't want to disrupt that.

I would prefer if all of the patches were in one patchset, pushed out by
one person as that would save me from having to respin my patch if all I
need to do is update it for the latest secid patches.  I think that has
value so people can review/test/etc all of the parts as one coherent
patchset.  However, it's ultimately up to you as you are the one working
on the main secid patchset.

I think it's easier to decide on policy, review the design, and test it
all if there is one place/patchset with all of the latest bits/patches.
 Right not it's not that easy with different patches scattered around.
