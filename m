Sure, you bet. David's scheme requires as LSM and is only capable
of supporting security namespace attributes. It is further not a
reasonable model for other memory based filesystems. If all you
ever want to support is SELinux, it would be fine, but an LSM
that uses multiple xattrs (Smack only uses multiple xattrs on
sockets, but it does use them) would be hard pressed to work off
of a secid. This is a swag at real xattr support, which is the
right thing to do for any filesystem. Special purpose interfaces
to solve a single instance of a problem are for squares.

I'll buy that, and happily incorporate improvements. The
crude locking is an artifact of keeping memory usage down.

There are less than 12,000 entries in /sys on my machine.
Is that really an issue?

Except that one could (fix the locking and) port this code to
other memory based file systems, such as smackfs or selinuxfs
without much bother. You'd have to implement new LSM hooks for
each file system you ported the other approach for. It
can be used without an LSM, it could support multiple security
xattrs and it can support other namespaces.

Nothing really. Once I abandoned the notion of starting from David's
code I didn't look back at it.

Only in the case where you have an LSM and the attribute you're
dealing with is the attribute that the LSM presents when you ask
the inode for the secid. I realize that that is the case that
SELinux finds compelling. That. David's code optimizes that case
like nobody's business at the expense of supporting any other case.

Again, this is xattr support. SELinux and Smack are LSMs that use
xattrs, but they are not the only use for xattrs.

That'll have to get fixed then.

Wouldn't be the first time I ripped out code at your suggestion.

Once again, you are assuming the presence of an LSM and the desire
to support exactly one xattr in the security namespace.

Thank you for the kind suggestions. The next version should be
much cleaner.
