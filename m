What if we drops the selinux hook related changes in the second patch
(the on-demand socket_sock_rcv_skb() [de-]registration)?

The patch will not conflict with the LSM hook structure becoming
read-only, we still retain the ability of registering/de-registering the
netfilter hooks, and that will still affect positively the tx network
performance.
