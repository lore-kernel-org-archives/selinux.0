Oh I didn't say that we must, I'm just trying to figure out what we want
to do in the case that a security.foo xattr is being set, and the foo
LSM is not compiled in.

What is being done right now is that CAP_SYS_ADMIN is required to do
the setting, and so doing

	setresuid(500,500,0);
	setfsuid(0);
	setxattr(somefilename, "security.SMACK64", LABEL, sizeof(LABEL), 0);

will fail the setxattr.
