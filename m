Ah. :(

Well, at least for UID-based checks, capability comparisons and
namespace comparisons, the relationship should be transitive, right?

The obvious solution would be to take a refcounted reference on the
old task's objective creds, but you probably want to avoid the
resulting cache line bouncing...

For safe_by_uid(), I think you could get away with just stashing the
last UID in a percpu variable, instead of keeping the full creds
struct around. That should be fairly cheap?

Namespace comparisons, and whatever SELinux/Smack/AppArmor do
internally, are probably more complicated, since you'd potentially
have to deal with changes of internal IDs and such if the policy gets
reloaded in the wrong moment.
For namespaces, perhaps you could give each namespace a unique 128-bit
ID and then save and compare those, just like UIDs.
For LSMs whose internal IDs might change after a policy reload, things
would probably be more messy. Perhaps you could save, e.g. for
SELinux, something like an (sid,policy_generation_counter) pair? I
don't know all that much about the internals of classic LSMs.

It seems to me like this could happen relatively easily if you have
one attacker task that keeps calling sched_yield() together with a
victim task on a logical core that's also running a softirqd? Attacker
voluntarily preempts, softirqd runs for packet processing, softirqd
ends processing, kernel schedules victim? I'm not sure how high the
injection success rate would be with that though.
