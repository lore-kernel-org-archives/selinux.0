I was thinking about it as well. But client can always bypass permissions
of lower device inode by first removing device file and then by doing
a mknod. And that will be equivalent of copy up. IOW, IIUC, we do not deny
mknod to client and that always creates a way for it to write to device
file (and it does not matter what are permissions on lower?)

sockets and fifos use overlay inode number (and not lower/upper inode
number). So even if we create a copy things continue to work. Copying
up will make sense upon owner or permission change to determine who
can open socket/fifo in future?
