Done.

I'm working on it, but as far as LSMs are concerned the LSM hook
is in place.

> kexec,

I'll note kexec has both a kernel and initramfs :) so just keep that
in mind. Technically it should vet for both. It seems we just need
an LSM hook there.

I'm sorry I do not follow, can you elaborate on what you mean by this.
Its not clear to me what you mean by the measurement list. Do you mean
all the above items?

Hrm, it can be, I mean at least for the kexec case its a fd that is passed
as part of the syscall, not sure of the other case you mentioned yet
as I haven't reviewed that code yet.

OK for each of these:

how do we load the data? Is that the full list? Note we should
be able to use grammar rules to hunt these down, I just haven't
sat down to write them but if this is important well we should.

Well, to be clear there is an exception that was made to firmware and that
reads things from /lib/firmware. Then other than this we have modules, kexec.
SELinuxfs uses its own fs... not sure of others.

Note, CRDA does have a custom path and userspace reads it from a custom
path, then tosses it via netlink to the kernel, I'm changing that to just
use /lib/firmware/ and repurpose the firmware API calls as generic "system data"
fetchers. But this is just because we found it reasonable for us to deploy
the regulatory.bin file into /lib/firmware.

A review would be needed for the other users. People can't just assume they
can use /lib/firmware for everything. I mean, its used now even for CPU
microcode so... just keep that in mind ;)

That's how CRDA works too but we never implemetned a filesystem just to toss
things to the kernel, we however did have hooks for a netlink API to send it.
The userspace agent vetted for the file's integrity. We'll be switching this
to have the file vetted through a signature which we trust in the kernel.

What each of these do is up to them.

Right, some technicalities in the implementation, but still its a file.

Seems reasonable to me. May require some macro hackery, not sure.

OK thanks will keep this in mind.

It'd be good for us to do a further review to really vet *all* areas.
I am not convinced we've covered them all.
