Absolutely, we just need to decide how to properly make it work with
selinux.  Maybe we check for

	allow (current_domain):(hijacked_process_domain) hijack
	type_transition hijacked_process_domain \
		vserver_enter_binary_t:process vserver1_hijack_admin_t;

The reason I decided to punt on this altogether is that the decision of
which type to use for the resulting process seems tricky and definately
requires new policy.

If we are using completely custom and simple policies for vservers, i.e.
every process in a vserver is type vserver_3_t, then it's not so
complicated.  But if I hijack a process in 'container 3', and the
resulting type is calculated in part based on the type of the hijacked
process, then I'll end up with a different type based on whether I'm
hijackign the init process, an ssh daemon, someone's shell, etc.  Then I
do some admin activity in that resulting process and end up labeling
files in the vserver based on the process I had hijacked.

Good point, I forgot about that.  So that may suffice for a permissions
check.  Now we just need to decide how to determine a type for the
resulting process.

Yes, especially if we don't have a single type for all processes in a
container.

Maybe what's needed is a more general discussion about how selinux
policy is to be used with containers, even without hijack.  I have a vm
set aside where I'm starting to write a container policy module.  I just
need to get a kernel lined up.  Was hoping to start next week.

In the meantime I still think it's prudent to punt on the selinux
hijacking code for now.
