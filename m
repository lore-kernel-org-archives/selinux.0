Well it's not the Smack behavior, it's the combination of Smack's
and SELinux's behavior :)

In the end what I have here is probably best anyway - what is
stored in the object hash is not a security struct as known
by any LSM, but a generic object label.  So at
object_hash_types[CKPT_OBJ_SEC]->restore(), we don't re-create
an actual security struct, but just a string which is later
used by security_xyztype_restore() to create an actual label.

A set of contexts (root_u:root_r:root_t:::system_u:system_r\
:system_t::...).

There would be a problem if it were stored as a more
structured type, and if the ->restore handler wanted to
re-create an actual task_security_struct, ipc_security_struct,
etc.  So the last paragraph in the patch intro was just trying to
explain why the intermediate layer, storing a generic string on
the c/r object hash, needs to be there.  The thing that is
not possible is to place the actual void *security or a struct
task_security_struct on the objhash.

Hmm, that should be doable.  Mind you these are not the same as
secctx's returned by secid_to_secctx.  Though selinux_release_secctx 
is implemented as a simple kfree, so it would 'just work.'  I'm
not sure if it's better to just re-use it, or introduce a new
security_release_context() that does the same thing...
