There are going to be lots of implications. Please look at the
bigger picture.

That's just insane. "It has been decided" by who? Obviously not people
who care about security policies. Maybe it's good enough for your
particular use case, but labeling of files has to be up to the security
module. That's what the modules are for.

What does that mean? If the underlying mechanism can't do the job,
how the dickens is the administrator supposed to make it happen?

But your mechanisms are simultaneously incomplete and over specified.

Your proposal is a cop out. It may work in a limited set of cases.
It is not a general solution.
