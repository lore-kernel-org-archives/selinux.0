What sort of authorization are you thinking of? I would expect
that to have been done by cachefileselinuxcontext (or
cachefilesspiffylsmcontext) up in userspace. If you're going to
rely on userspace applications for policy enforcement they need
to be good enough to count on after all.

good points all, in spite of my personal distaste for secids.
