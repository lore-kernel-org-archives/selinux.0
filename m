Every subsystem is different, but in general I haven't found it too
difficult to determine if a given patch is stable worthy; on the rare
occasion that I'm uncertain I'll ask the submitter for their opinion.
I wouldn't say I discourage people from adding a stable tag, it is
just that I don't require people to add one to make it into my stable
queue, and I don't automatically add it to the queue if the poster
does tag it so (although that said, I don't recall ever removing a
stable CC).

This patch is definitely a stable no-brainer.

It may, I generally wait until the stable devs pick it up and if they
hit a merge conflict I fix it up, however, since you offered I may
kick it your way ;)
