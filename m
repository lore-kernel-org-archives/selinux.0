Great the patches I have in place for the system data helpers let us
deprecate this and put that code in a dark corner.

If there are no users for it and since we are talking about bringing
things together I'd prefer if we try to come up with a shared solution
for that as it seems it can wait for kexec.

OK fine :)

OK great, I think that instead of passing the actual routine name we should
instead pass an enum type for to the LSM, that'd be easier to parse and we'd
then have each case well documented. Each LSM then could add its own
documetnation for this and can switch on it. If we went with a name we'd have
to to use something like __func__ and then parse that, its not clear if we need
to get that specific.

Sure.
