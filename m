That is the approach I'm taking. The kernel configuration
will specify which LSM gets Netlabel and which gets XFRM.

A Smack configuration that does not use Netlabel is possible,
but to my mind extremely uninteresting. If someone has a
use case that is best addressed using both Smack and SELinux*
it seems that the most likely configuration would be for
Smack to use Netlabel and SELinux XFRM.

I have not seen patches, but as Smack+AppArmor and SELinux+AppArmor are
included in my success criteria for module stacking I have to keep the
plan in mind. BTW, Smack+SELinux is not a success criteria, but it would
sure feel good to be able to claim total victory.

I'm trying not to make too many architectural changes to the
code around the LSM mechanism itself. I don't see that as cost
effective or likely to be popular. If the implication of that is
that there are certain configurations that are unsupportable but
that have plausible alternatives I think it will do for phase I.

If you want SELinux using Netlabel and Smack using Netlabel at
the same time you're going to have to change something. That
might well involve reimplementing Smack in SELinux policy*,
switching SELinux to XFRM if that's reasonable or using other
mechanisms like containers. It's not like we have a shortage
of mechanisms available.

Agreed. I understand that priorities shift like sands
in the desert.

Yeah, you have to give people rope. The Kconfig files can suggest
something rational, but in the end people do the darnedest things.
Especially with security.

It breaks down on 127.0.0.1. Otherwise is looks pretty easy to do.

4am, five time zones from home and hungover. The write-up looked
good, but it's a complete rewrite.

This fell out of my first shot at stacking, the one that never saw
the light of day for tax reasons. I had implemented a stacker LSM
that slid into the existing infrastructure. Hooks that asked for
secids got the secid from my LSM, not the underlying LSM secids.
There was a table much like the Smack label list that mapped the
global secids to sets of underlying secids. The obvious problem
is that that table grows quickly and can never go away.

It seemed like that would be a reasonable approach until AppArmor
started looking like a "big" LSM.
