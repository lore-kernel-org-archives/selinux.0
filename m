It is, but with no differentiation to how the connection was initially

It doesn't matter whether the fd is inherited or passed over a unix
domain socket, the problem is the same. The fd and the underlying socket
will have the type of the creating process. So, yes there is control but
there is no differentiation; either a child can inherit/receive the
existing connection from xinetd or it cannot, regardless of how the
connection was initiated.

Another way of looking at this is that if a single type is used for all
related packets the network controls that we can place on, for example,
ftpd depend on whether it listens directly to the ftp port or it runs
through xinetd. This seems unfortunate.

Right, I understand that, but it seems that much of that granularity is
lost when connection tracking is used.

For example, if we have a xinetd execute the ftp daemon in different
domains based on the network interface, originating ip address, etc.
(presumably for confidentiality reasons). With the single related packet
type we must completely trust xinetd to pass the correct connections to
the ftp daemon in the correct domain: the related packets that the ftpd
will be the same regardless of whether the initial packets where
extif_ftp_packet_t or intern_ftp_packet_t.

If the security context of the related packets is the same as the
packets for the connection establishment we no longer have to trust
xinetd.

Ok - I obviously don't have the expertise to judge how ugly the code to
do this is. It becomes a question of whether the feature is compelling
enough.
