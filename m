Looks like Smack requires CAP_MAC_ADMIN in order to set Smack attributes 
on a file at all.  So nfsd would require that capability for Smack.  I 
think this means however that setting Smack labels on NFS files won't 
work in any case where root is squashed, which seems unfortunate.

On the SELinux side, we don't require CAP_MAC_ADMIN to set the SELinux 
attribute on a file in the normal case, only when the SELinux attribute 
is not known to the security policy yet.  So granting CAP_MAC_ADMIN 
there means that a client will be able to set security contexts on files 
that are unknown to the server.  I guess that might even be desirable in 
some instances where client and server policy are different.  We do have 
the option of denying mac_admin permission in policy for nfsd 
(kernel_t?), in which case we would block such attempts to set unknown 
contexts but would still support setting of known security contexts.

So I think it is workable, albeit a bit confusing.
