Would you mind explaining which filesystem types do you plan to allow?
SELinux and the rest of Linux S&M bunch do fuck-all for attacks via
handcrafted fs image fed to the code in fs driver that does not expect
a given kind of inconsistencies.

As it is, validation of on-disk metadata is not particularly strong;
what's more, protection against concurrent malicious *changes* of
fs image (via direct writes by root) is simply inexistent.

So what is that about?
