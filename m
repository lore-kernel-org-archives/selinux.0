Hmm, for some reason I was still thinking that we stored an encoded
form of the label even in xattrs.  Whoops!

On the other hand, I guess it should be noted that the "common" case
of an SELinux label is the inline storage case, labels are on average
no more than ~40 bytes:
  system_u:object_r:sysadm_homedir_t:s0

In filesystems that are space optimized (like squashfs), we still
prefer to pack xattrs, symlinks, and even file permissions as tightly
as possible through table lookups of various forms.  Heck, the
read-only squashfs only stores a single empty-directory inode and
references it wherever needed.

On the other hand, if you're doing something completely silly with 64k
labels then any hope of inline storage went out the window along with
any space savings from nifty FS optimizations like de-duplication or
tail-packing.
