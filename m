Can you think of a situation where we would need to atomically change
multiple entries?  I envisioned a sys admin stopping their application
or server, relabeling the ports and then restarting them.  Maybe there
is a specific case you know about that I've overlooked?

If you want to change the label on a range you can do it with the atomic
add operation.  The only time you would need to pop all the ports and
push them back is resizing a range.

There is no question that a userspace tool like setsebool will have to
be written to save the modified policy.  I used a text parsing interface
to stay consistent with the current selinuxfs interfaces where you can
echo numbers into files to modify functionality.  Would adding a
structure ingesting write interface break consistency?
