Yeah that makes it harder. Possible but harder.

Matthew, Peter and Gary are Cc'd, so they can feel free to chime in.

There are other alternatives as well:

 * Is there wide use of SELinux + IMA ? If so that may be another option.

 * The kernel cert stuff can also allow for installing keys *later* which
   could be trusted specifically for SELinux Policy files, but that'd
   mean having to generate / sign these someway up in the food chain.

These are all worth considering not just for SELinux but any other form of
machine-specific data from files which might need to be fed to the kernel.

Are there other use cases other than SELinux policy files?

Anyway, its good we're reviewing this early before patches for SELinux
policy file stuff for signing are brewed. The APIs will be there, but need
to be advanced slightly for firmware signing anyway so there is time for
you folks to think about what route you want to go. If you *do* determine
you need it, it seems pretty easy to handle.

Ah thanks, great, one less thing to think about. So it would just be
the enum and OID that would be needed, should you guys go down the
kernel signing route.
