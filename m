The names are based on the calling security hook.   For a description of
each of these security hooks refer to include/linux/lsm_hooks.h.

Oh, I'm really confused as to why MOK would be a separate hook.  I
thought the discussion was about using a key in the UEFI MOK DB for
verifying locally signed files.
