Can you clarify whether, with this patch, Linux will then have a complete 
labeled network implementation in terms of both LSPP compliance and common 
user requirements?

This needs to be resolved, along with labeling for all kernel owned 
socket/tw objects.  I'm not entirely clear on why this doesn't already 
work, as it is using IPsec, which should certainly be able to encapsulate 
all of this traffic.

It would also be interesting to know what kind of testing this code as 
had.
