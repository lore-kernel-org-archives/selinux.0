Indeed, these access rights should follow the
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE mechanic.

What about a program that just need to read files? We can think about
sanboxes such as those used in web browsers, but that applies to other
tailored processes that don't need/want to access metadata e.g., for
confidentiality or personal information (UID, timestamp) concerns.

This is similar to FILE_WRITE vs. TRUNCATE: most of the time we want
them to be grouped.
