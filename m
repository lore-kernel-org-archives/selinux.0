That makes sense.

So then what is wanted is to check that the other id is either invalid,
or else it maps into s_user_ns. So for chown_ok() something like this:

    if (!uid_valid(inode->i_uid) &&
        (!gid_valid(inode->i_gid) || kgid_has_mapping(inode->i_sb->s_user_ns, inode->i_gid)) &&
        ns_capable(inode->i_sb->s_user_ns, CAP_CHOWN))
            return true;

and likewise for chgrp_ok(). Does that satisfy your concerns?

Okay, I'll add checks.
