My apologies, I must have forgotten/missed that discussion.  Do you
have an archive pointer?

I'm still not sure this makes complete sense to me, but since I'm
still not 100% confident in my understanding of SCTP I'm willing to
punt on this for the moment.

Okay.  Better.

It's actually not that bad, take a look at the NNP/nosuid patch from
Stephen, af63f4193f9f ("selinux: Generalize support for NNP/nosuid
SELinux domain transitions"), pay attention to the
"selinux_policycap_nnp_nosuid_transition" variable.

Yes, I think my comment was the result of faulty SCTP understanding on my part.
