Dave brought up some good questions. A pseudo file-system based on ports
seems like a good idea but I think there is going be scaling issues.
SELinux also supports multiple labels for ports. Port 22 can be labeled
as ssh_port and if the label is removed, reverts to reserved_port. Do
you know of a way xattrs can handle this?
