Booting F14 with your patch applied yields a large number of AVC denials
of the form:
type=AVC msg=audit(1296503592.932:1220139): avc:  denied  { read } for
pid=1896 comm="gnome-settings-" path="anon_inode:inotify"
dev=anon_inodefs ino=5312
scontext=system_u:system_r:xdm_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
tcontext=system_u:object_r:unlabeled_t:s0 tclass=file

So I assume that the anon_inodefs inodes are being marked private too,
and relying on that test within inode_has_perm to avoid permission
checks.  Which would mean that you need to leave that test alone after
all.

The /proc labeling looks good though.
