Just FYI- The labeled-ipsec patch doesn't affect or influence the
packet class handling in any manner.

Could you list the mangle table rules and see that the above IPv6
addresses are covered (i.e. labeled appropriately) or otherwise that
your policy allows kernel_t to receive all packets (may or may not be
desired/good, just thinking out loud).

The port info is currently available only for tcp/udp packets.

James can perhaps comment on this better, but it *should* be covered
to the extent that you are able to define mangle table/secmark rules
for them.

This is possible with kernel changes, specifically by adding protocol
to avc_audit_data. If Stephen agrees I can look into doing it.
