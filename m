It's unfortunate that you cut out the code in your reply.

Yep, I agree.

Well, reading the code I see that if the secmark is zero upon entering
the function you query the XFRM subsystem to query the SA label and set
the secmark accordingly, yes?  All I am suggesting is that we do the
same thing for NetLabel.

Please see the mail I sent earlier with the code in it to address James'
concerns, this has a proposed solution for the flow_out case.

As implemented in the code snippets I sent earlier the generated
NetLabel SID would reflect the secmark as determined by the IPsec label
and the IP options on the packet.  I believe this is what we want as the
resulting secmark value would directly represent the security attributes
of the packet.
