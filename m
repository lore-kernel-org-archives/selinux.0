No idea.

I looked at the old flow cache but i don't see any of these extra
checks there either.

However, old flow cache stored flowi struct as key, and that contains a
flowi_secid,  populated by the decode_session hooks.

Was it enough to check for identical flowi_secid in the flowi structs to
avoid this problem or am i missing something?
