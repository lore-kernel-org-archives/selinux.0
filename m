Ahh good idea. Forgot about that! So associate the
READ_METADATA right with the fd at open time like with truncate.

Your argument is persuasive :)

I still have open questions about file_getattr(2)
and the FS_* ioctls above, which I don't think are handled by this
READ_METADATA right. access(2) is a seperate question, but I'm
unsure if that's worth it/in scope for restricting.

(I think WRITE_METADTA also doesn't handle file_setattr(2) and
the FS_IOC_FSSETFLAGS ioctls)
