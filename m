Are you speaking of security_kernel_act_as() and security_create_files_as()
specifically?  Or the task_struct::act_as override pointer in general?

I don't really know how nfsd wants to obtain and set its LSM context, so it's
a bit difficult for me to make something that works for nfsd as well as
cachefiles.

How does cachefilesd come up with such a context?  Grab it from
/etc/cachefilesd.conf?

I use to do that, but someone objected...  Possibly Karl MacMillan.

I seem to remember that I was told that it should be done this way, possibly
by Karl MacMillan, but I don't remember exactly.

Now it's configured by cachefilesd.te:

	type_transition cachefilesd_t kernel_t : process cachefiles_kernel_t;
